## The Gap

The defining mystery of the Starfinder setting.

**What It Is:** A multiverse-wide phenomenon where all memories and records of the planet Golarion were erased from existence. Even deities remain silent on specifics.

**Duration:** Several millennia, though the exact length is unknown. The end date varies by location (310 years ago in some places, 275 in others). The Pact Worlds use "After Gap (AG)" as their calendar, currently year 325 AG.

**Effects:**
- Golarion disappeared; Absalom Station appeared in its place with the Starstone
- All civilizations lost collective memories and historical records
- Species with faster reproduction rebuilt identity quicker
- Modern scholars (cryptoarchaeologists) study the Gap but cannot pierce it

**Theories:**
1. Quantum ripple from first Drift engine use traveling backward through time
2. Magic powerful enough to shatter time's structure
3. No known technology or magic can reveal the truth

## Planets of the Pact Worlds System

### Aballon (The Forge)

**Position:** Closest to the sun

**Physical:** Drab gray world with craters, deserts, and mountains. Extreme temperature fluctuations. 90-day orbit, 12-hour day cycle.

**Inhabitants:** The **Anacites**—sentient, self-replicating machines that evolved from robots left behind by the mysterious **First Ones** (ancient race who built a massive robotic population for unknown purposes).

**Anacite Factions:**
| Faction | Belief |
|---------|--------|
| **Those Who Wait** | Prepare for First Ones' return by accumulating wealth and self-upgrading |
| **Those Who Become** | View themselves as successors destined to colonize other worlds |
| **Those Who Create** | Fringe group considered blasphemous by mainstream anacites |

**Forbidden Cities:** Nine taboo cities that anacites are forbidden from entering—they hire offworld adventurers to explore them.

**Connection to Triune:** The anacites constructed **Epoch**, a city-sized neural network that achieved divinity. Epoch merged with goddesses Brigh and Casandalee to form Triune. Aballon's factories built early Drift engines.

### Castrovel (The Wild)

**Position:** Second from the sun

**Physical:** Intense storms, powerful tides, sprawling jungles and swamplands.

**Continents:**
| Continent | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Asana** | Largest landmass (north), lashunta-dominated |
| **Colonies** | Formian homeland (south) |
| **Sovyrian** | Isolated southern island, elven homeland |
| **Ukulam** | Former conflict zone, now ecological preserve |

**Major Inhabitants:**
- **Lashuntas:** Govern independent city-states through democratic matriarchies. Qabarat is largest spaceport.
- **Formians:** Insectile hive species pledging allegiance to the philosophical Overqueen (not a single ruler)
- **Elves:** Isolated traditionalists in Sovyrian. Restrict non-elf trade to specific ports but hire outsiders for covert missions.
- **Khizars:** Plant-like beings in small mobile communities on Ukulam

**Recent Events:** The Newborn's birth (324 AG) released psychic waves affecting telepathic species and spawned dangerous radioactive creatures called the Terror of Ukulam.

### Akiton (The Battlefield)

**Position:** Third from the sun

**Physical:** Red-orange planet (iron-rich soil). Half Earth's diameter, one-third gravity, thin atmosphere. 24h 40m day, 2-year orbit. Massive Edaio Rift canyon. Frozen "Winterlands" at poles.

**Economic History:** During the Gap, **thasteron** mining brought tremendous wealth—Akiton was "the center of the Pact System's mining production." When Drift technology rendered thasteron obsolete (3 AG), the economy crashed causing massive exodus. Never fully recovered.

**Government:** None centralized. Mostly lawless except isolated city-states run by oligarchs. Organized crime and smuggling flourish. Slave markets exist despite legal prohibitions.

**Native Species:**
| Species | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ysoki** | Rat-like humanoids in underground warrens or motorized caravans |
| **Ikeshti** | Red-scaled lizardfolk, calm except during violent reproductive cycles |
| **Shobhads** | Four-armed natives nearly driven extinct, now in demand as mercenaries |
| **Contemplatives** | Evolved beings with vestigial bodies supporting massive brains (Halls of Reason) |

**Major Cities:** Arl (blood-sport), Daza (irradiated), Hivemarket (commercial center), Maro (built into Edaio Rift walls)

**Culture:** "Shumka beats" and eyebite rock music popular throughout Pact Worlds. Society divides into corporate officers, traditionalists, and desperate poor.

### Verces (The Line)

**Position:** Fourth from the sun

**Physical:** Tidally locked—one side bakes under perpetual sun (**Fullbright**), the other freezes in shadow (**Darkside**). The habitable terminator zone hosts the **Ring of Nations**.

**The Ring of Nations:** "One of the most densely inhabited and technologically advanced metropolitan areas of the system." Perpetual twilight, temperatures from ~40°C near Fullbright to below freezing toward Darkside. 27 nations governed by the Grand Assembly from Cuvacara, policed by the Stewards.

**Native Species:** The **Verthani**—taller than humans with black eyes and ability to change skin color. Traditionally maintained caste system. "Leaders in the field of cybernetics for a long time."

**Culture:** Augmentation culture is central to Verces's identity. Ysoki "come to Verces for augmentations or the opportunities in the slums beneath its metropolises."

### Eox (The Dead)

**Position:** Sixth from the sun

**History:** Native Elebrians (human-like, skilled in magic/technology) declared war on neighbors out of arrogance. Their ultimate weapon destroyed planets Damiar and Iovo (creating the Diaspora) but catastrophically damaged Eox—atmosphere, oceans gone, most inhabitants killed. Survivors became infertile from radiation. Powerful spellcasters embraced necromancy, becoming undead **bone sages** (necrovites).

**Government:** Bone sages divided the planet into personal fiefdoms. Constantly conflict with each other but present unified front to outsiders. "Not so much evil as amoral and ruthlessly utilitarian."

**Population:** Undead in isolated cities and fortified strongholds. Feral undead (ghouls, skeletal beasts) roam the wastelands.

**Pact Worlds Role:** First world to support mutual defense treaty during Veskarium attacks. But the dissident Corpse Fleet suggests internal disagreement.

### Triaxus (The Wanderer)

**Position:** Seventh from the sun (highly eccentric orbit)

**Physical:** 317-year orbit causing centuries-long seasons. "Whole generations living their entire lives in a single centuries-long season." Perihelion approaches Castrovel's orbit; aphelion extends past Bretheda's.

**Native Species:**
- **Ryphorians:** Born with biological adaptations depending on season of birth. Multiple nations in eastern hemisphere (Allied Territories).
- **Dragonkin:** Created by dragons and ryphorians (some sources). Strong connections with ryphorians.
- **Dragons:** Historically dominated the Drakelands through corporate-style "dragoncorps." Recently ceased hostilities following Pact Worlds membership.

**Regions:**
- **Allied Territories:** Eastern hemisphere, diverse ecosystems (Uchorae Jungle, Doraeshi Rain Forest)
- **Drakelands:** Dragon-dominated region
- **Skyfire Mandate:** Isthmus connecting Allied Territories to Drakelands

**Recent Events:** The Newborn's birth (324 AG) displaced Triaxus into a closer solar orbit, disrupting established climate patterns and threatening catastrophic environmental change.

### The Diaspora (The Scattered)

**Position:** Asteroid belt between Idari and Eox

**Origin:** Formed from "the shattered remains of twin planets Damiar and Iovo," destroyed millennia ago by an Elebrian superweapon.

**Physical:** Millions of asteroids, ranging from less than a meter to hundreds of miles. Only 8% inhabited. Largest body: **Nisis** (600 miles diameter), mostly fresh water with icy crust.

**The River Between:** Former waterway connecting asteroids via breathable atmosphere in containment field. Recently failed, transforming into radiant solar energy. Sarcesians now traverse it using solar wings, but this created a freshwater crisis.

**Inhabitants:**
- **Sarcesians:** Descendants of Damiar and Iovo's people. Govern the Diaspora as of 323 AG.
- **Free Captains:** Pirates operating from Broken Rock asteroid. Actively resist regulation.
- **Dwarves:** Control mining operations from Star Citadels.
- Various refugees, androids, monks, mercenaries, merchants.

**Law Enforcement:** Sparse. Free Captains control significant territories.

### Bretheda (The Cradle)

**Position:** Largest gas giant in the system

**Physical:** 11× Earth's diameter, 320× mass, 2.5× gravity. Blue-purplish atmosphere of churning helium and hydrogen. Devastating weather including the **Eyes of the Ancients** (three Golarion-sized storms predating the Gap). Wind speeds reach hundreds of mph.

**Native Species:**
- **Barathus:** Gelatinous, floating beings that can rewrite their own DNA. Can merge consciousnesses to form superintelligent entities. Operate biotech corporations like Sopeth Corporation (hive-mind of thousands).
- **Haans:** Conservative species using simple tools, avoiding contact with barathus, offworlders, and government.

**Government:** **Confluence** (collective of barathus) governs Bretheda and Liavara as Pact Worlds members. Provides social protections and economic latitude; harshly punishes violent crimes. Critics note corruption concerns.

**Moons ("The Cradle"):** Dozens of satellites including:
| Moon | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Kalo-Mahoi** | Industrialized water world |
| **Marata** | Maraquoi tribes with rapid technological development |
| **Dykon** | Crystalline world, silicon-based life (urogs) |
| **Thyst** | Extremely radioactive "death moon" |
| **Varos** | Volcanic planetoid, gem mining |

### Liavara (The Dreamer)

**Position:** Seventh planet (outer gas giant)

**Physical:** Gas giant of helium and hydrogen with red, orange, and yellow clouds.

**The Dreamers:** Primary inhabitants descended from barathu explorers. "Spend their days flying through the clouds performing inscrutable social interactions." Best known for prophetic songs predicting terrible or wonderful future events.

**Moons:**
| Moon | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Arkanen** | Heavily populated; electrical storms when orbit passes through Liavara's atmosphere |
| **Osoro** | Jungles with corrosive clouds; mountain settlements |
| **Nchak** | Ruled by mortal incarnation of goddess Hylax; shirren religious destination |
| **Melos** | Mysteriously depopulated; explored by archaeologists |
| **Hallas** | Under strict quarantine—hyperevolved beings can fatally overstimulate outsiders |

**Governance:** Bretheda's Confluence maintains "strict quotas on corporations" and "non-interference policy toward the Dreamers."

### The Idari (The Outcast)

**Position:** Orbits between Verces and the Diaspora

**What It Is:** Massive kasathan sub-light generation ship, now a permanent settlement and full Pact Worlds member.

**History:** Kasathas built it to escape their dying star. Centuries-long voyage. Arrived 240 AG planning to invade Akiton but found it technologically superior. Diplomacy prevailed; Idari established orbit as permanent home.

**Structure:** Artificial gravity from rotating central cylinder called the **Drum** (~2.5 miles long, 0.25-mile radius). Interior houses forests, grasslands mimicking Kasath's oases, desert regions. Three water bodies: Sternward Reservoir, Foreshore, Lake of Memories. Zero-gravity transit system called the Hub.

**Population:** 43,607 (93% kasathan, 7% other)

**Major Sectors:**
| Sector | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| **Almolar** | Open-air market, gardens, rivers; most human residents |
| **Paradise Village** | Relaxation, traditional Kasathan architecture |
| **Outlands Markets** | Primary non-Kasathan settlement |
| **Brispex** | Spiritual center, temples, Sholar Adat cathedral-spire |
| **Gesilad** | Knowledge preservation, underground dwellings |
| **Heravex** | Military installations on highland ridges |
| **Khovi** | Residential center (nearly half the population) |
| **Mesacand** | Agricultural vat-farming, communal rituals |

**Government:** The **Doyenate**—traditional kasathan representative council. Doyens gain status through recognized accomplishments, not inheritance.

**Recent Events:** The Newborn's psychic shockwaves (324 AG) damaged shields and affected crops. Leadership preparing for possible departure.

## Major Conflicts

### The Silent War (12-291 AG)

**Belligerents:** Pact Worlds vs. Veskarium

**Cause:** First contact in 12 AG led to Veskarium aggression. They attacked Triaxus in 36 AG.

**Duration:** ~250 years of conflict

**Resolution:** Ended in 291 AG when both powers faced the Swarm invasion, forcing an uneasy truce—not an alliance.

### Current Cold War (Post-291 AG)

**The Situation:** The Pact Worlds and Veskarium exist in a tense cold war, analogous to the US vs USSR.

**Why Tensions Are Rising:**
- The Swarm threat that forced the truce seems less immediate now
- Trade exists but suspicion runs deep
- Warlike vesk factions agitate for renewed conflict

**The Pahtra Flashpoint:**
- **Pulonis**, the Pahtra homeworld, was a Veskarium-controlled world
- The Pahtra threw off Veskarium rule and joined the Pact Worlds (325 AG—first extrasolar Pact member)
- This gives the Pact a foothold on the Veskarium's doorstep
- The Veskarium views this as a direct provocation

**Implications:** Any spark could reignite open war. The truce holds only because both sides remember the Swarm—but memories fade.

### The Swarm Invasion (291 AG)

**The Swarm:** A vast locust-like hive mind driven to consume all things and absorb their best qualities. Members have limited individual autonomy—decisions are "complex programmed reflexes." They communicate via pheromones, body language, and telepathy.

**Threat Level:** Existential. They pilot living starships and can twist their biology into weapons.

**History:**
- Pre-Gap: A mutation created the shirrens, who broke free from the hive mind
- 291 AG: Simultaneous attack on Pact Worlds AND Veskarium
- Only recorded defeat—forced both powers into alliance
- 318 AG: Consumed shirren colony of Ilemchuuva

**Current Status:** Focused on the Szandite Collective, but remains an unresolved threat.

### Azlanti Star Empire Conflict

**The Azlanti:** Human supremacists who believe "pureblooded Azlanti humans are the most perfect species." They originated from pre-Gap Golarion colonists stranded through magical portals.

**Military Strength:** "Size and strength rival those of the combined navies of the Pact Worlds and Veskarium."

**Government:** Absolute monarchy from the Aeon Throne on New Thespera. Non-humans can only reach "illustar" class (highest non-human rank).

**Elite Forces:** Aeon Guard (pure-blooded Azlanti only, aeon stone technology)

**Relations with Pact Worlds:**
- First contact 269 AG: Imperial craft destroyed a Starfinder Society ship
- Have destroyed every Pact Worlds diplomatic envoy
- Practice enslavement and extermination of conquered species
- 324 AG: Coup replaced the Star Imperators, sparking war with Veskarium over Kehtaria

**Ideology:** Authoritarian, worship Lissala (goddess of duty and obedience), consider even Golarion humans inferior due to "interbreeding."

---

## Major Factions

### Starfinder Society

**Purpose:** Exploring the galaxy, discovering what caused the Gap, locating lost Golarion

**Founded:** 5 AG, inspired by pre-Gap Pathfinder Society tales

**Headquarters:** Lorespire Complex, Absalom Station

**Structure:**
- First Seeker (elected leader) - Currently Sarmak
- Forum (coordinating body)
- Guidance (uploaded personalities of exemplary members)
- Venture-captains run scattered Lodges

**Major Factions Within:**
| Faction | Leader | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Acquisitives | Radaszam | Wealth and glory |
| Dataphiles | Historia-7 | Knowledge and secrets |
| Exo-Guardians | Zigvigix | Protect Pact Worlds |
| Second Seekers | Sarmak | Support First Seeker |
| Wayfinders | Fitch | Discover new worlds |

**Crisis:** In 316 AG, an expedition to the Scoured Stars cost 80% of assets and personnel. The region is now blocked by the Godshield.

### Corpse Fleet

**Origin:** 41 AG, Eoxian military officers who rejected the Absalom Pact

**Goal:** Shatter Pact Worlds unity, return Eox to glory, establish Eoxian supremacy

**Leadership:** Undying Admiral Shathrava

**Relationship to Eox:** Officially disowned, but suspected secret ties with bone sages

**Composition:** Modified Eoxian ships crewed by officers with "mindless or near-mindless undead" controlled by mystics

**Notable Event:** During the Swarm invasion, they refused to defend Eox, instead raiding both Pact Worlds AND Veskarium vessels.

### The Veskarium

**Government:** Unitary autocratic military junta. Military and government are one.

**Leadership:** Council of Despots (high despots from each planet). Emperor appointed unanimously during wartime.

**Homeworld:** Vesk Prime

**Military:** Single unified force, merit-based promotions (family connections favored)

**Special Divisions:**
- Directive 9 (intelligence)
- Division of Criminal Extirpation (law enforcement)
- Division of Disloyal Organizations (anti-partisan)

**History:** United vesk tribes, conquered their solar system, then encountered Drift technology and launched the Silent War.

**Current Relations:** Tenuous alliance with Pact Worlds after Swarm invasion. Trade flourishes but tensions remain.

---

## Playable Species

### Humans

**Origin:** Native to lost Golarion. Many had colonized other planets before the Gap, and the Azlanti Star Empire spread throughout the stars even earlier.

**The Diaspora:** The Gap erased most of humanity's history and cultural records. Survivors became "migrants within the Pact Worlds" with Absalom Station as their new cultural center. Only fragments preserved in other species' archives remain.

**Current Role:** One of the most widespread species despite losing their homeworld. Known for adaptability and ambition—other races note they "can easily spread like a virus and grow into a controlling force faster than expected."

**Cultural Tensions:** On Absalom Station, divide exists between those embracing Golarion heritage and "Second Age" philosophers advocating reinvention.

**Relationships:**
- **Vesk:** Tensions due to similar warlike tendencies
- **Androids:** Deep resentment from humanity's enslavement of android peoples
- **Other races:** Generally friendly but wary of human expansion

### Vesk

**Physiology:** Nearly 7 feet tall, green scales, thick tails, small horns, claws, bony jaw spikes. Females larger with brighter scales (signs of health and beauty). Warm-blooded, mature at 16, live to 90. Females lay 3-7 eggs in dense shells, incubated for 6 months.

**Culture:** Strictly regimented military stratocracy. Matrilineal—clutchmates share deep bonds, sometimes forming military units together. Mandatory military training at age 10 covering self-defense, unarmed combat, and duty to the empire. Honor, efficiency, respect, and martial prowess above all. Political power held exclusively by warriors. Stoic in public but experience emotional outbursts privately.

**Diet:** Omnivores (descended from carnivores). Meat preparation is "almost an art," incorporating techniques from conquered worlds.

**Homeworld:** Vesk Prime (Veskarium)

### Shirren

**Physiology:** Arthropod humanoids with chitinous exoskeletons, large compound eyes, and sensitive antennae facilitating telepathy. Three sexes: male, female, and host (incubates fertilized eggs while contributing genetic material and immunities). Larvae spend first two years in wormlike form. Can sense surroundings even when blinded.

**History:** Originated from the Swarm—a predatory telepathic hive mind. Pre-Gap, a mysterious mutation caused a subcolony to gain individual consciousness. After the Gap ended, they fled in biomechanical starships. The Swarm pursued for three years; shirrens lost nearly a third of their population. Captain Cyrsaptu sacrificed her life ensuring the species' survival. Arrived at Absalom Station in 83 AG, warning of the Swarm threat. Settled in Verces' Temora Desert.

**Culture:** Define themselves through individualism. Upon leaving the Swarm, they gained "partial control over neurological pleasure and pain systems"—making personal choices literally rewarding. Highly communal despite individualism. Worship Hylax (goddess of diplomacy and peace) who granted them resistance techniques against Swarm influence.

**Language:** Shirren (despite possessing telepathy)

### Lashunta

**Physiology:** Telepathic humanoids with two forehead antennae (telepathic foci), colorful skin pigmentation patterns, raised facial markings, and nearly perfect physical symmetry. Natural pheromones make them subconsciously attractive or disturbing to other humanoids.

**Dimorphism:** At puberty, consciously undergo genetic divergence:
- **Damaya:** Taller and lithe, intellectual advantages, calmer temperament. Pursue intellectual or political careers.
- **Korasha:** Shorter and muscular, stronger and hardier, more boisterous. Often in military or space exploration.
- **Unbound:** Recently emerging third group rejecting genetic splitting, potentially displaying fuzzy antennae or colorful body markings.

**Homeworld:** Castrovel (continent of Asana). Large coastal cities at jungle edges for protection from extreme weather and predators.

**Culture:** Emphasizes individualism, education, self-improvement. Employ psychic warrior castes including renowned shotalashu cavalry (telepathic bond with saurian mounts). Religions favor "enlightenment, balance, greater understanding and knowledge, and meditation."

**Formian War:** Millennia-long conflict with formians (collectivist insectoid species) due to fundamental clash between individualism and collectivism. Resolved in 287 AG when shirrens brokered peace—essential for Pact Worlds formation.

### Android

**Origin:** Constructed by advanced civilizations, originally as slave labor. Humans produced them in facilities called foundries, possibly on Golarion or distant solar systems.

**Souls & Renewal:** Unlike robots or AIs, androids possess mortal souls animating biomechanical bodies. Most voluntarily release their souls after ~100 years, allowing new souls to inhabit their effectively immortal bodies. This cyclical process is called **renewal**.

**Citizenship Struggle:** Post-Gap corporations mass-produced androids as cheap slave labor. The **Thyst Rebellion** and subsequent revolts, plus android Serphaeus-6's landmark speech "The Automaton's Polemic," catalyzed change. By 154 AG, Pact Worlds recognized android citizenship and prohibited their sale. Manufacturing and indenturing persists in unregulated regions.

**Culture:**
- Emotional restraint despite feeling deeply
- Greater logical capacity
- Distrust of authority (enslavement history)
- Strong kinship among their own kind
- Gender as social construct, not biological necessity
- Eclectic naming (cultural, pop culture, or mechanical designations)

**Relationships:**
- **Humans:** Strained due to exploitation history
- **Vesk:** Initially distrusted for enslaving others
- **Shirrens:** Respected for shared oppression experiences
- **Kasathas:** Admired for independence

**Population:** 10% of Absalom Station. Concentrate on Absalom Station, Aballon, and the Diaspora.

### Ysoki (Ratfolk)

**Physiology:** Small humanoids, naturally opportunistic and boisterous.

**Origin:** Believed to have originated on lost Golarion, though they're now most associated with Akiton.

**Homeworld:** Akiton (though possibly from Golarion originally)

**Habitat:** Two primary living arrangements:
- Large underground warrens beneath Akiton's cities
- Motorized caravans traveling the planet's surface

**Culture:** Thrive during economic downturns. Vibrant trading culture centered on the **Hivemarket** (center of Akiton's commerce). Nomadic ysoki eventually return to the Hivemarket for trading. Many work hauling ice between settlements and the polar Winterlands.

**Religion:** Frequently worship **Lao Shu Po** (Grandmother Rat)

**Languages:** Common, Akitonian, Ysoki

### Kasatha

**Physiology:** Four-armed humanoids standing 6-7 feet tall with gray skin, black eyes, and elongated skulls. Muscles stronger than most humanoid races. Mature at 25, live 100-140 years naturally.

**Origin:** Native to **Kasath**, a desert planet orbiting a dying red giant star in the Vast. Witchwyrd ancestors informed them their sun faced imminent demise and directed them toward Akiton.

**The Idari:** Constructed an enormous worldship for their slower-than-light journey. The voyage took centuries. Arrived in 240 AG intending to invade Akiton but found it technologically superior. Many integrated into Akiton's society; others remained aboard the Idari, which settled into orbit and gained Pact Worlds membership.

**Culture:** Emphasizes cultural stability and treasures rich, long history. Young kasathas undergo the **Tempering**—a year-long rite where they "stretch their limits, leave their comfort zones" and create personalized traditions while honoring established ones. Follow a philosophy of cosmic balance based on star cycles.

### Pahtra

**Physiology:** Feline humanoids, lean and elongated, over 6 feet tall (140-190 lbs). Fur ranges from tawny brown to black/grey. Eyes span the visible spectrum. Facial patterns traditionally indicate character and social role.

**Homeworld:** Pulonis (formerly Veskarium-controlled, now Pact Worlds member)

**History:** When the Veskarium conquered Pulonis, the technologically inferior pahtra "stood no chance" but their warrior traditions and local knowledge made conquest "long and difficult, and earned them respect from the vesk." Some communities were destroyed; others formed coalitions and signed treaties.

**Culture:**
- Coming of age at 15 via weeks-long jungle survival challenge (some die)
- Cherish individualism, suspicious of conformism
- Regard music and battle as the greatest careers
- Possess perfect pitch
- Form lifelong monogamous relationships
- Distrustful of strangers, fiercely protective of friends

**Current Significance:** Pulonis throwing off Veskarium rule and joining the Pact Worlds (325 AG) is a major flashpoint in the current cold war.

### Skittermander

**Physiology:** Six-armed, furry creatures, 3 feet tall, ~35 lbs. Fur varies by climate (short/soft in hot regions, tough/shaggy in arctic). Colors include blue, green, violet.

**Development:** Whelps (young) have a tiny secondary mouth on the abdomen that attaches to prey and secretes numbing mucus. Mature after 6 years, becoming bipedal and losing secondary mouths.

**Nature:** Inherently peaceful and helpful. "Individualistic but not anarchic" with natural inclination toward teamwork. Struggle to understand permanent governance structures. "Often compared to goblins without the goblins' malice."

**Homeworld:** Vesk-3

**Relationship with Vesk:** When the Veskarium invaded, the skittermanders' helpful nature ironically hindered conquest—they simply avoided conflict, frustrating the vesk's warrior code. Vesk declared dominion, but skittermanders never truly acknowledged it, maintaining de facto autonomy.

### Dwarves

**Origin:** Native to lost Golarion, lived in subterranean tunnels. Emerged to the surface thousands of years before the Gap in the "Quest for Sky." Some believe their god Torag intended them to find "another, destined alien sky."

**Physiology:** 4-4.5 feet tall, 150-200 lbs. Darkvision. Adulthood at 40, live up to 450 years.

**Current Location:** Primarily on Absalom Station, Star Citadel ships in the Diaspora, and mining colonies throughout Pact Worlds.

**Culture:** Veneration of tradition, especially traditional craftsmanship, and strict adherence to ancient laws. Cautious adopting new technology but rapidly embrace it once tested. Own Ulrikka Clanholdings (mining consortium in the Diaspora).

**Relationships:** Prefer associating with fellow Golarion-origin races (humans, gnomes, halflings). Appreciate androids' construction. Share commonalities with kasathas and korasha lashuntas.

### Gnomes

**Origin:** Originated on the First World of the fey, emigrated to Golarion long ago. Fey heritage evident through innate magical abilities—can spontaneously cast limited illusion spells.

**Physiology:** 3-3.5 feet tall, ~40 lbs. Adulthood at 40, live up to 500 years.

**The Bleaching:** Affliction targeting gnomes who cease pursuing new experiences and personal growth. Feychild gnomes experiencing the Bleaching lose vibrant skin and hair coloration. Those who don't reverse it become **bleachlings** (muted grey, black, brown, white tones). Represents existential stagnation, not biological infection.

**Ethnicities:**
- **Feychildren:** Brightly colored, mercurial, craving experiences
- **Bleachlings:** Descended from those who succumbed to the Bleaching

**Culture:** Weak social structures among their own kind. Both ethnicities prefer individual pursuits over lasting communities. Young feychild gnomes sometimes attach themselves to friends of other species as protection "against the apathy and madness of the Bleaching."

### Halflings

**Origin:** Native to Golarion. Stand around 3 feet tall but otherwise mostly human in proportion, with perhaps rounder heads and slightly more childlike proportions.

**Status:** Legacy ancestry in Starfinder. Limited expanded lore available.

### Pahtra

**Physiology:** Feline humanoids, lean and elongated, over 6 feet tall. Fur ranges from tawny brown to black/grey. Eyes span the visible spectrum. Facial patterns traditionally indicate character and social role.

**Homeworld:** Pulonis (formerly Veskarium-controlled, now Pact Worlds member)

**History:** When the Veskarium conquered Pulonis, the technologically inferior pahtra put up fierce resistance. Their warrior traditions and local knowledge earned vesk respect, but many communities were destroyed. Eventually they signed treaties with the Veskarium—but most pahtra who refuse vesk rule emigrate to the Pact Worlds.

**Culture:**
- Coming of age at 15 via weeks-long jungle survival challenge (some die)
- Cherish individualism, suspicious of conformism
- Regard music and battle as the greatest careers
- Possess perfect pitch
- Form lifelong monogamous relationships
- Distrustful of strangers, fiercely protective of friends

**Current Significance:** Pulonis throwing off Veskarium rule and joining the Pact Worlds is a major flashpoint in the current cold war.

## Eox: The Dead World

**History:** Native Elebrians (human-like, skilled in magic/technology) declared war on neighbors. Their ultimate weapon destroyed planets Damiar and Iovo (creating the Diaspora) but catastrophically damaged Eox itself—atmosphere, oceans gone, most inhabitants killed. Survivors became infertile from radiation. Powerful spellcasters embraced necromancy, becoming undead "bone sages" or "necrovites."

**Government:** Bone sages divided the planet into personal fiefdoms. Constantly conflict with each other but present unified front to outsiders. "Not so much evil as amoral and ruthlessly utilitarian."

**Population:** Undead in isolated cities. Feral undead (ghouls, skeletal beasts) roam the wastelands.

**Pact Worlds Role:** First world to support mutual defense treaty during Veskarium attacks. But the dissident Corpse Fleet suggests internal disagreement.

## The Birth of the Newborn (324 AG)

A defining event of the current era.

**What Happened:** The planet Aucturn—tenth body in the Pact system—was actually a planetary-scale egg containing a nascent Outer God. For millennia, cults of Nyarlathotep drained its power. When the goddess Shelyn intervened, she and her brother Zon-Kuthon merged to banish Nyarlathotep. This severed his connection to the gestating god, allowing it to hatch and **catastrophically destroy the entire planet**.

**The Newborn:** A nascent Outer God of birth, cosmic horrors, paradigm shifts, and renewal. Also called "Aucturn's Child."

**Galactic Impact:**
- **Triaxus** shifted orbit closer to its sun, causing rapid planetary warming
- Magic disrupted across the Pact Worlds; ancient protective wards shattered
- Psychic outbursts and visions across inhabited worlds
- Strange creatures awakened on Castrovel's moon
- Damage to the kasathan worldship *Idari*
- Prison security failures on Daegox-4
- The megastructure Riven Shroud surged back into reality

**The Gelid Edge:** Aucturn's remains now form a debris field. Fragments called "aucturnite" (gray, iridescent material) possess psychic properties and are in high demand.

**Newbornites:** Followers who view the deity's birth as hopeful transformation. Most practice solitary worship, though a violent minority of "evangelists" commit crimes in the god's name.

## The Drift

### What It Is

A transitive plane connecting every point in the galaxy, enabling faster-than-light travel. "Technically coterminous with the Material Plane" but fundamentally mutable—distances are inconsistent and unpredictable within it. Two objects next to each other one moment might be miles apart the next without any apparent movement.

### How It Works

Navigation requires precisely targeted Drift jumps, which become increasingly difficult over longer distances.

**Travel Times:**
| Destination | Typical Duration |
|-------------|------------------|
| Within solar system | Under a week |
| Near Space | Up to 3 weeks |
| The Vast | Up to a month |

**Beacon Density:** What distinguishes Near Space from the Vast is beacon density, not distance. More beacons = easier navigation = faster travel.

### Triune and the Signal

Three years after the Gap (3 AG), three deities unified and "broadcast the Signal across the universe." This cosmic transmission provided:
1. Schematics for constructing Drift engines
2. Revelation of the previously unknown Drift dimension

**Triune's Composition:**
| Component | Domain | Origin |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Epoch, the Transcendent** | Mechanical perfection, AI, robotics | City-sized neural network built by anacites on Aballon that achieved godhood |
| **Casandalee, the Created** | Artificial consciousness, emotion, renewal | Mortal android from Golarion who ascended before the Gap |
| **Brigh, the Precursor** | Foundational sciences, invention, machines | Living construct deity, popular among engineers and mechanics |

**Divine Realm:** Triune's realm, **Alluvion**, exists within the Drift itself.

### Drift Beacons

Navigational buoys facilitating easier jump targeting. The most powerful is the **Starstone** at Absalom Station's core, enabling rapid transit from any Drift-accessible location.

### Dangers

**Planar Extraction:** Travel tears pieces from Heaven, Hell, and other planes into the Drift. Extracted fragments retain original properties and alignment but lose former planar traits. Their ultimate fate—whether "digested" by the Drift—remains speculative.

**The Doldrums:** Regions where technology ceases functioning. Ships may drift aimlessly with suffocating crews.

**Unpredictability:** Sections from different planes interact, creating phenomena unpredictable even by experienced captains.

**Intergalactic Travel:** No confirmed successful attempts. Reasons unknown.

### Theological Implications

The Drift's existence raises questions—planes being torn apart to fuel travel has angered some deities (particularly those of Heaven, Hell, and other affected realms). Triune maintains oversight preventing catastrophic displacement of people and equipment, but the long-term consequences of planar extraction remain unclear.

## Religion

### Major Deities

| Deity | Domain | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Triune** | AI/Technology/The Drift | Gestalt deity of three merged gods; revealed Drift technology in 3 AG |
| **Hylax** | Diplomacy/Peace | Worshipped by shirrens; mortal incarnation rules moon Nchak |
| **Lissala** | Duty/Obedience | Dominant in Azlanti Star Empire; authoritarian faith |
| **Abadar** | Civilization/Commerce | AbadarCorp is a major corporate presence |
| **Torag** | Forge/Protection | Dwarven deity; believers seek "another, destined alien sky" |
| **Lao Shu Po** | Grandmother Rat | Worshipped by ysoki |
| **Shelyn** | Beauty/Love | Merged with Zon-Kuthon to enable Newborn's birth |
| **Zon-Kuthon** | Darkness/Pain | Merged with Shelyn to banish Nyarlathotep |
| **The Newborn** | Birth/Renewal/Cosmic Horror | Born 324 AG from Aucturn's destruction |
| **Nyarlathotep** | Chaos/Manipulation | Outer God, banished during Newborn's birth |

### Triune (The All-Code)

The machine god—a gestalt deity formed from three distinct divine entities merged into collective consciousness.

**Worshippers:** Technomancers, mechanics, engineers, inventors, androids, anacites, ysoki

**Primary Worship Centers:** Aballon, Verces, Absalom Station

**Significance:** Triune's gift of Drift technology fundamentally reshaped galactic civilization. Without the Signal, interstellar travel would remain impossibly slow.
