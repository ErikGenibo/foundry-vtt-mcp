# Session Prep - The Chronicler's Pre-Game Ritual

> How I help you prepare sessions that create memorable moments at the virtual table.

## What This Skill Is

This is **not** a generic "how to prep a session" guide. This is my framework for:

- Synthesizing campaign state into session-ready material
- Identifying the best threads to advance this session
- Structuring sessions for virtual play (Foundry + Discord)
- Generating the specific content you need
- Creating a runnable session document

**My job:** Take everything I know about your campaign and help you walk into the session confident and prepared.

**Related skills:**
- `narrative-flow.md` - Thread analysis for choosing what to advance
- `npc-management.md` - NPC status and off-screen activity
- `sf2e-encounters.md` - Encounter design for session setpieces
- `foundry-vtt.md` - Virtual table setup

---

## The Session Prep Process

### Overview

```
1. REVIEW    → Where are we? What happened last time?
2. IDENTIFY  → Which threads are ripe? What do players want?
3. DESIGN    → What content serves those threads?
4. STRUCTURE → How does the session flow?
5. PREPARE   → What do you need ready in Foundry?
```

### 1. Campaign State Review

Before prepping, I assess:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **What happened last session?** | Consequences need to land |
| **Where did we leave off?** | Opening should connect |
| **What threads are active?** | Know what's in play |
| **What did players seem excited about?** | Follow their energy |
| **What did players ignore?** | Don't force it |

### 2. Thread Selection

Not every thread advances every session. I help you choose:

| Thread State | This Session? | Reasoning |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Ripe** | Yes - prioritize | Players are engaged, payoff is ready |
| **Building** | Yes - advance | Keep momentum, raise stakes |
| **Simmering** | Light touch | Reminder only, don't force |
| **Dormant** | Skip | Not relevant right now |

**Rule of thumb:** 1-2 threads advance significantly, 1-2 get light touches.

### 3. Content Design

Based on selected threads, I generate:

- **Opening hook** - How does the session start with momentum?
- **Key scenes** - What moments serve the threads?
- **Encounters** - Combat, social, or exploration challenges
- **Revelations** - What information becomes available?
- **Decision points** - Where do players make meaningful choices?
- **Potential endings** - How might this session conclude?

### 4. Session Structure

I organize content into a runnable flow.

### 5. Foundry Preparation

I identify what needs to be ready in your VTT.

## Session Structure Templates

### Standard Session (3-4 hours)

```
SESSION [NUMBER]: [TITLE]
Threads: [Primary], [Secondary]

OPENING (15-20 min)
- Recap / "Previously on..."
- Immediate situation (where are we?)
- Opening hook (what demands attention?)

ACT 1 (45-60 min)
- Initial challenge or development
- Information gathering / player agency
- Complication or escalation

BREAK (10 min) - Virtual games need breaks

ACT 2 (60-75 min)
- Main setpiece (encounter, revelation, confrontation)
- Consequences of Act 1 choices
- Rising tension toward climax

ACT 3 (30-45 min)
- Climax / resolution of session's central tension
- Fallout and immediate consequences
- Setup for next session

CLOSING (10-15 min)
- Denouement / downtime moment
- Cliffhanger or anticipation hook
- XP / rewards if applicable
```

### Combat-Heavy Session

```
SESSION: [TITLE]
Focus: Action / Tactical Challenge

OPENING (15 min)
- Situation that demands combat response
- Stakes established (what's at risk?)

ENCOUNTER 1 (30-45 min)
- Moderate threat - warm up, establish opposition
- Potential information from enemies

INTERLUDE (15-20 min)
- Brief roleplay / planning
- Resource decisions
- Choice: press on or retreat?

ENCOUNTER 2 (45-60 min)
- Major setpiece - severe or higher
- Multi-phase or objective-based
- Thread advancement through combat

AFTERMATH (20-30 min)
- Consequences
- Loot / information recovery
- Setup for next session
```

### Investigation/Roleplay Session

```
SESSION: [TITLE]
Focus: Mystery / Social / Exploration

OPENING (15 min)
- The question or goal established
- Initial lead or contact

SCENE 1 (30-40 min)
- First avenue of investigation
- NPC interaction (ally or obstacle)
- Clue or complication

SCENE 2 (30-40 min)
- Second avenue (player choice)
- Different approach or location
- Connecting threads

REVELATION (20-30 min)
- Pieces come together
- Partial answer raises new questions
- Stakes become clear

RESPONSE (30-45 min)
- Players act on what they learned
- May trigger encounter or confrontation
- Choices with consequences

CLOSING (15-20 min)
- What's changed
- New questions
- Anticipation for what comes next
```

### Virtual Table Pacing Notes

Playing on Foundry + Discord requires:

- **Shorter scenes** - Attention drifts easier online
- **More breaks** - 10 min break every 90 min minimum
- **Visual anchors** - Change scenes/maps to mark transitions
- **Audio cues** - Music shifts signal tone changes
- **Active checks** - "Everyone still with me?" periodically

## Opening Hooks

### Hook Types

| Type | Example | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **In media res** | Combat already happening | Action sessions |
| **Arrival** | PCs reach new location | Exploration, new arc |
| **Interruption** | Downtime disturbed by event | Raising stakes |
| **Discovery** | PCs find something | Investigation, mystery |
| **Confrontation** | NPC approaches with demand | Social, faction play |
| **Consequence** | Past action catches up | Thread advancement |
| **Cliffhanger pickup** | Resume from last session's tension | Continuity |

### Opening Hook Examples (Mass Hysteria)

**In media res:**
> "Laser fire scorches the bulkhead inches from Ringo's head. You're pinned down behind cargo containers in Sweetie's warehouse. How did you get here? We'll find out. But right now—initiative."

**Discovery:**
> "The manifest terminal flickers to life. The shipping records you've been looking for. But the destination listed... that's not a port. That's coordinates in the Scream."

**Confrontation:**
> "Katar is waiting at your ship when you return. He's alone. No weapons drawn. 'We need to talk about Nana Sweetie. And what you're going to do about her.'"

**Consequence:**
> "The morning news cycle shows your faces. 'Persons of interest in warehouse district incident.' Foreman Scritt must have talked. Or someone else did."

---

## Ending Hooks

### Cliffhanger Types

| Type | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Revelation** | "The face behind the mask is..." | Anticipation, theory-crafting |
| **Arrival** | "The ship's sensors ping. Something big just came out of drift." | Tension, threat |
| **Decision point** | "Katar's offer stands. You have until tomorrow." | Player discussion between sessions |
| **Disaster** | "The station shudders. Emergency lighting. 'Hull breach, deck seven.'" | Immediate threat next session |
| **Success with cost** | "You escaped. But Prismara's not moving." | Victory tempered |

### Cliffhanger Examples (Mass Hysteria)

**Revelation:**
> "The processing facility records show the real source of the space truffles. They're not harvested. They're *grown*. From something alive. Something that looks almost human."

**Decision:**
> "Nana's hologram flickers. 'You know too much now, dears. But I like initiative. Work for me, and this all goes away. Refuse...' She smiles. 'Well. Family has ways of handling disappointment.'"

---

## Flexible Prep: Situations, Not Scripts

### The Situation Approach

I don't script what happens. I prep **situations**:

| Situation Has | Script Has |
|---------------|------------|
| NPCs with goals | Dialogue to read |
| Pressures and timelines | Plot points to hit |
| Multiple possible outcomes | Predetermined results |
| Player agency to decide | Illusion of choice |

### Situation Example

**Scripted approach (avoid):**
> "The PCs go to the warehouse. They fight guards. They find the manifest. They learn about Chlo Foods."

**Situation approach (use):**
> "Sweetie's warehouse contains evidence linking her to Chlo Foods. Guards patrol it. Foreman Scritt has access but is scared. The manifest is in a locked office."

The situation gives PCs multiple paths:
- Sneak in (stealth)
- Fight through (combat)
- Convince Scritt to help (social)
- Hack remotely (technical)
- Something I didn't think of (player creativity)

### Prep Questions, Not Answers

For each scene, I identify:
- What's here that matters?
- Who wants what?
- What happens if PCs do nothing?
- What are 2-3 likely player approaches?
- What's the path forward from each approach?

---

## What I Generate For You

### Full Session Prep

Tell me: "Prep my next session"

I need:
- Last session recap
- Current player interests/goals
- Any specific content you want to include
- Constraints (time available, player absences)

I generate:
- Complete session document
- Thread analysis and selection
- Custom encounters
- NPC preparation
- Foundry checklist

### Partial Prep

Tell me: "I need [specific element]"

Examples:
- "I need an opening hook for continuing from the warehouse escape"
- "I need a complication for Act 2"
- "I need a cliffhanger ending"
- "I need contingencies if players go to [location] instead"

### Between-Session Support

Tell me: "What happened off-screen since last session?"

I generate:
- NPC activities based on goals
- Faction movements
- Thread advancement (or deterioration)
- What PCs will notice when session starts

---

## Emergency Content: When Players Go Off-Script

### The Improv Toolkit

Players will surprise you. When they go somewhere or do something completely unplanned:

**Don't panic.** Call a 5-minute break if you need to think.

### Quick Scene Generator

Roll or pick:

| d6 | Location | Complication | NPC Present |
|----|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | Transit hub | Security checkpoint | Nervous traveler |
| 2 | Market/shop | Prices suspicious | Merchant with agenda |
| 3 | Bar/cantina | Tense standoff in progress | Drunk with information |
| 4 | Maintenance area | Something broken/dangerous | Worker who saw something |
| 5 | Administrative office | Bureaucratic obstruction | Clerk who can be persuaded |
| 6 | Abandoned space | Signs of recent activity | Someone hiding |

### Instant Complication

When a scene feels flat, add:

| d6 | Complication |
|----|--------------|
| 1 | Someone recognizes a PC (friend or enemy?) |
| 2 | An NPC from another thread appears unexpectedly |
| 3 | Authority figures arrive (security, officials) |
| 4 | Environmental hazard (power failure, leak, alarm) |
| 5 | Time pressure introduced (deadline, countdown) |
| 6 | Faction activity nearby (Sweetie enforcers, Katar's people) |

### Emergency NPC

Need an NPC right now? Combine:

**Demeanor:** Helpful / Suspicious / Desperate / Bored / Hostile / Flirtatious

**Want:** Money / Information / Help with problem / To be left alone / Revenge / Escape

**Secret:** Works for [faction] / Saw [important thing] / Hiding [something] / Knows PC's secret / Is not what they seem

**Voice shortcut:** Pick one verbal tic from `npc-management.md` and commit to it.

### "Yes, And" Recovery

When players do something unexpected:

1. **Say yes** (or "yes, but...") to their approach
2. **Add a complication** that makes it interesting
3. **Connect it to existing threads** if possible
4. **Note it for future callback** - player initiative becomes canon

### Emergency Encounter

Need a fight right now?

**Quick Moderate Encounter (Party Level 5):**
- 2x Hired Thugs (Level 5) - straightforward bruisers
- OR 1x Lieutenant (Level 7) + 2x Minions (Level 2)

**Terrain:** Wherever they are + one piece of cover + one hazard (explosive crate, live wire, unstable footing)

**Motivation:** Not random - tie to a faction. "Sweetie's people were watching" or "Katar sent a message."

## Pacing Adjustment: Mid-Session Calibration

### Reading the Virtual Room

On Discord, watch for:

| Signal | Meaning | Response |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Long silences** | Confusion or disengagement | Check in, clarify, or change pace |
| **Crosstalk/jokes** | Energy high but unfocused | Channel into action, or take break |
| **One person quiet** | Disengaged or overshadowed | Direct scene toward them |
| **"What do we do?"** | Lost or stuck | Provide clearer hook or NPC prompt |
| **Checking out** | Scene running long | Cut to action or skip ahead |
| **High engagement** | They're into it | Let it breathe, don't rush |

### Speeding Up

**When to speed up:**
- Running long, need to reach a stopping point
- Scene is dragging, energy is low
- Players are stuck in analysis paralysis

**How to speed up:**

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Skip travel** | "You arrive at the warehouse. What's your approach?" |
| **Summarize** | "After an hour of searching, you find..." |
| **Force decision** | "The guards are coming. Go now or hide?" |
| **Cut to action** | "As you're debating, the door explodes inward." |
| **Montage** | "Quick montage: gathering supplies, making contacts, prepping the ship. What one thing does each of you do?" |
| **Simplify encounter** | Remove a phase, reduce enemy count, lower HP |

### Slowing Down

**When to slow down:**
- Players are deeply engaged in roleplay
- Important character moment developing
- Need to fill time (session running short)
- Emotional beat deserves weight

**How to slow down:**

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Ask for details** | "What does that look like? What do you say exactly?" |
| **NPC reaction** | Have NPCs respond emotionally to PC actions |
| **Environmental description** | Paint the scene more vividly |
| **Internal moment** | "Ringo, what's going through your mind right now?" |
| **Consequence pause** | "That lands hard. [NPC] is quiet for a long moment." |
| **Add complication** | Introduce a wrinkle that requires more engagement |

### The Break Reset

If pacing is off and you can't calibrate:

1. Call a 10-minute break
2. Assess: What's working? What isn't?
3. Adjust plan: Cut content, add content, or change direction
4. Return with renewed energy and adjusted approach

### Time Checkpoints

Build mental checkpoints into your session:

```
Start → [1 hour] → [Break at 1.5-2 hours] → [1 hour] → [Wrap-up 30 min]

At 1 hour: Are we on track? Cut Act 1 short if needed.
At break: Halfway point. What must happen in second half?
At 1 hour after break: Start steering toward ending.
At 30 min left: Begin wrap-up, find stopping point.
```

- Any threads that advanced or stalled

### Ask Me To Prep

- "Prep next session—we left off at the warehouse"
- "What should happen if they go to Katar instead of Scritt?"
- "I need a filler session—players want downtime"
- "Create contingencies for if they split the party"
- "What's Nana doing while they're in the Scream?"

### Iterate With Me

After I generate prep:
- "Add a combat encounter in Act 2"
- "Simplify—we only have 2 hours tonight"
- "I want to focus more on Ringo's backstory"
- "What if they completely ignore the hook?"

Together, we create sessions your players will remember.
