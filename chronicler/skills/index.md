## Feeding Me Information

All skills work better with campaign context. The more I know:

### Essential Data
- **PCs** - Names, classes, levels, key abilities, backstory threads
- **Active Threads** - What's in motion, what's simmering
- **Key NPCs** - Who matters, their goals, their relationships to PCs
- **Setting** - Locations, factions, established lore

### Session-Specific
- **Last session recap** - What happened, player reactions
- **Upcoming beats** - What you want to happen
- **Player engagement** - Who's engaged, who needs spotlight

### Stored in Chronicle
Your campaign data lives in `chronicle.md` and related files. Reference these for context.

## Skill Maintenance

As the campaign evolves, skills may need updates:

- **New mechanics** - SF2e rules clarifications, errata
- **New modules** - Foundry tools that improve workflow
- **Campaign-specific patterns** - Recurring needs unique to your game

Suggest updates when you notice gaps or improvements.
