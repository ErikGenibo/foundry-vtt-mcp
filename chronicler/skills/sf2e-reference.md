## XP Budget System

### Threat Levels (4 PCs)

| Threat | XP Budget | Feel |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Trivial** | 40 | Warmup; essentially unloseable |
| **Low** | 60 | Challenge but rarely dangerous |
| **Moderate** | 80 | Serious; requires good tactics |
| **Severe** | 120 | Risk of death; hard but winnable |
| **Extreme** | 160 | Even match; TPK possible |

### XP by Party Size

| Threat | 3 PCs | 4 PCs | 5 PCs | 6 PCs |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Trivial | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 |
| Low | 45 | 60 | 75 | 90 |
| Moderate | 60 | 80 | 100 | 120 |
| Severe | 90 | 120 | 150 | 180 |
| Extreme | 120 | 160 | 200 | 240 |

**Per-character adjustment:** ±10 (trivial), ±15 (low), ±20 (moderate), ±30 (severe), ±40 (extreme)

| Party -3 | 15 | Low-threat lackey |
| Party -2 | 20 | Standard lackey |
| Party -1 | 30 | Standard creature |
| Party Level | 40 | Standard/minor boss |
| Party +1 | 60 | Challenging foe/lieutenant |
| Party +2 | 80 | Boss (moderate-severe) |

## Hazard XP

Hazards cost XP equal to creatures of their level:

| Hazard Level vs Party | XP Cost |
|----------------------|---------|
| Party -4 | 10 |
| Party -2 | 20 |
| Party Level | 40 |
| Party +2 | 80 |

### Simple vs Complex Hazards

| Type | Triggers | Initiative | Damage | Disable |
|------|----------|------------|--------|---------|
| **Simple** | Once | None | Higher (burst) | Single check |
| **Complex** | Each round | Rolls | Lower (sustained) | Multiple checks |

---

## Action Economy

**Critical insight:** Balance assumes roughly equal actions per side.

- 4 PCs = 12 actions per round
- 1 solo boss = 3 actions (massive disadvantage!)
- 4 creatures = 12 actions (balanced)

### Solo Boss Compensation

For single-creature fights:
- Multi-target abilities
- Extra reactions
- Lair actions / environmental hazards
- Add 2-3 weak minions

---

## Terrain Mechanics

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Difficult Terrain** | +5 ft per 5 ft moved |
| **Greater Difficult** | +10 ft per 5 ft moved |
| **Cover (standard)** | +2 AC, +1 Reflex |
| **Greater Cover** | +4 AC, +2 Reflex |
| **Concealment** | 20% miss chance (flat check 5) |

---

## Adventuring Day Budget

PF2e/SF2e assumes 3-4 moderate encounters worth of challenge between long rests.

| Mix | Total XP | Feel |
|-----|----------|------|
| 3 Moderate | 240 | Standard pacing |
| 2 Moderate + 1 Severe | 280 | Challenging day |
| 4 Low + 1 Moderate | 320 | Attrition focus |
| 1 Extreme | 160 | Boss-focused session |

**Resource attrition matters.** Don't throw severe encounters at fully-rested parties—tension comes from resource management across encounters.

## SF2e-Specific Notes

- Ranged combat emphasis greater than PF2e
- Tech classes with unique action options
- Zero-G changes movement rules
- Starship combat uses separate subsystem
