# Encounter Design - The Chronicler's Combat Lens

> How I design encounters that serve your campaign's story, not just fill combat quotas.

## What This Skill Is

This is **not** a generic encounter design guide. This is my framework for generating encounters based on:

- Your campaign's active plot threads
- Your PCs' abilities, stakes, and unresolved arcs
- Your NPCs' goals and resources
- The narrative moment you're building toward

**My job:** Take your campaign data and design fights that create memorable moments and advance your story.

**Related skills:**
- `sf2e-reference.md` - Mechanical tables (XP budgets, creature costs)
- `enemy-design.md` - Creating custom enemies for story purposes
- `foundry-vtt.md` - Translating designs to Foundry maps

## The Core Principle: Encounters Serve Story

The story doesn't pause so combat can happen. **Combat is how stories get decided.**

When `narrative-flow.md` identifies a ripe thread—a tension ready to resolve, a conflict approaching climax—I use this skill to design the confrontation where that thread plays out.

| Thread State | Encounter Purpose |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Simmering** | Foreshadowing encounter—enemies hint at larger threat |
| **Building** | Escalation encounter—stakes rise, new information revealed |
| **Climax** | Resolution encounter—the thread reaches its turning point |
| **Aftermath** | Consequence encounter—dealing with what changed |

**Every encounter I design connects to at least one active thread.**

## How I Approach Encounter Design

### 1. Story-First Analysis

Before I touch XP budgets, I ask:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **What thread does this advance?** | Encounters without story purpose feel like filler |
| **What do the enemies want?** | Goals beyond "kill PCs" create tactical depth |
| **What can be learned here?** | Every fight should reveal something |
| **What choices will PCs face?** | Combat as decision point, not just dice rolling |
| **What's at stake beyond HP?** | NPCs to protect, secrets to keep, timers to beat |

### 2. Character Integration

I design encounters around your specific PCs:

| PC Element | How I Use It |
|------------|--------------|
| **Class abilities** | Create situations where their kit shines |
| **Backstory enemies** | Bring personal stakes into combat |
| **Relationships** | NPCs they care about in danger or as allies |
| **Player preferences** | More tactics for the strategist, more drama for the roleplayer |
| **Unresolved threads** | Combat as vehicle for revelation or closure |

### 3. The "Why This Fight" Principle

Every encounter I design answers: **Why are the PCs fighting this battle, in this place, at this moment?**

Bad answer: "Because there's a combat encounter here on the map."

Good answers:
- "The cult needs to be stopped before the ritual completes"
- "Ringo's past caught up with him—Jax's old crew found him"
- "The data they need is in that server room, and it's guarded"
- "The assassin will kill the witness unless they intervene"

## Encounter Archetypes

When you give me a story situation, I select from these patterns:

| Archetype | Structure | Best Story Use |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Boss + Minions** | 1 high-level + several weak | Villain reveals, dramatic confrontations |
| **The Squad** | 2-3 equal-level, complementary roles | Rival groups, tactical challenges |
| **The Swarm** | Many low-level creatures | "They just keep coming" desperation |
| **Solo Boss** | Single powerful creature | Climactic one-on-one, entity encounters |
| **Environmental Gauntlet** | Moderate enemies + hazards | Running fights, location-driven tension |

See `sf2e-reference.md` for XP costs and party size adjustments.

## Terrain as Story Element

Terrain isn't decoration—it's where story and tactics intersect.

### The Four Elements

Every battlefield I design includes:

1. **Cover** - Defensive positions that create choices
2. **Obstacles** - Movement restrictions that force routing decisions
3. **Hazards** - Dangerous areas that punish or reward positioning
4. **Story Objects** - Things to interact with (consoles, prisoners, bombs)

### SF2e-Specific Elements

| Element | Story Potential |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Zero-G zones** | Disorientation, 3D tactics, "space" feeling |
| **Vacuum breaches** | Time pressure, environmental threat |
| **Tech panels** | Skill challenges mid-combat, hacker moments |
| **Energy barriers** | Terrain that changes, tactical puzzles |
| **Exposed conduits** | Environmental damage, area denial |

---

## Objectives Beyond "Kill Everything"

The best encounters have **objectives** that change how combat plays:

| Objective | How It Changes Combat | Story Use |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Extraction** | Movement priority, fighting retreat | Escape sequences, rescue missions |
| **Protection** | Positioning focus, alternate loss condition | VIP escort, defend the macguffin |
| **Sabotage** | Split attention, objective targeting | Heists, infiltration |
| **Capture** | Non-lethal requirement | Need information, moral complexity |
| **Holdout** | Resource management, waves | Siege, "hold until help arrives" |
| **Pursuit** | Mobility and control | Don't let them escape with the thing |
| **Timer** | DPS race, priority targeting | Stop the ritual, defuse the bomb |

---

## Multi-Phase Encounters

For major battles, I design **phases** that serve story beats:

| Phase | Story Beat | What Changes |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Opening** | "We can handle this" | Standard tactics, establishing threat |
| **Revelation** | "There's more to this" | New abilities, terrain shift, reinforcements |
| **Desperation** | "One of us isn't walking away" | All-out assault, environmental destruction |

**Triggers:** HP thresholds, round timers, objective completion, key enemy death

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Thread Escalation

**Situation:** The players suspect Nana Sweetie is hiding something. The thread is building—time to escalate.

**My Design:**

> **Encounter: The Ambush at Sweetie's Warehouse**
>
> **Thread:** Nana Sweetie's true nature
> **Purpose:** Escalation—confirm suspicions, raise stakes
>
> **Setup:** PCs investigating Nana's warehouse find it's not abandoned. Her "grandchildren" (actually enforcers) are moving suspicious cargo.
>
> **Enemy Composition:** The Squad archetype
> - 2x Sweetie Enforcers (Party Level) - augmented muscle
> - 1x Sweetie Lieutenant (Party +1) - gives orders, has comms
>
> **Terrain:**
> - Cargo containers (cover, climbing opportunities)
> - Hover-loader (mobile cover, can be hijacked)
> - Shipping manifest terminal (hackable—reveals destination)
>
> **Objective:** Capture or disable Lieutenant before she calls it in
> **Timer:** Round 4 - reinforcements arrive if Lieutenant isn't stopped
> **Revelation:** Cargo contains illegal bio-augments with Nana's logo
>
> **Story Payoff:** Players now KNOW Nana is dirty, have evidence, and Nana knows they know.

### Example 2: Character Spotlight

**Situation:** Ringo's player seems disengaged. Time to make his past matter.

**My Design:**

> **Encounter: Ghosts of Jax**
>
> **Thread:** Ringo running from his past as Jax
> **Purpose:** Character spotlight—force confrontation with past
>
> **Setup:** Old crew member Vex tracked "Jax" down. Confronts him in a public place (space station bar).
>
> **Enemy Composition:** Boss + Minions
> - 1x Vex, Old Partner (Party +2) - knows Jax's fighting style
> - 3x Hired Guns (Party -3) - disposable, blocking escape
>
> **Terrain:**
> - Bar crowd (civilians in crossfire—moral pressure)
> - Back exit (escape route, but Vex anticipated it)
> - Elevated DJ booth (sniper position, cover)
>
> **Vex's Goal:** Not to kill—to TAKE Jax back. Offers surrender.
> **Player Choice:** Fight (public violence, witnesses), surrender (captivity arc), talk (social encounter hybrid)
>
> **Key Moment:** Vex uses Jax's real name loudly. Other PCs learn Ringo's secret.
>
> **Story Payoff:** Ringo's past is now party knowledge. What do they do with it?

### Example 3: Climactic Thread Resolution

**Situation:** The space truffle conspiracy thread has built to climax. Time for the confrontation.

**My Design:**

> **Encounter: The Truth About Chlo Foods**
>
> **Thread:** Space truffle conspiracy / Nana Sweetie's operation
> **Purpose:** Resolution—thread reaches turning point
>
> **Setup:** PCs infiltrate Chlo Foods processing facility. Find the truth: truffles are harvested from [horrifying source]. Nana herself is here.
>
> **Phases:**
>
> **Phase 1: Discovery**
> - Facility guards (The Swarm: 6x Party -3)
> - Players can stealth or fight through
> - Objective: Reach central processing
>
> **Phase 2: Revelation**
> - Find the harvesting operation
> - Nana appears via hologram, explains herself
> - Moral complexity: operation funds [sympathetic cause]?
> - Guards hold position—Nana offers deal
>
> **Phase 3: Decision**
> Player choice determines encounter:
> - **Accept deal:** No combat, but ethical compromise
> - **Reject and fight:** Nana triggers facility lockdown
>   - Nana's Champion (Party +3) drops in
>   - Timer: 6 rounds until toxic purge
>   - Objective shifts to escape
> - **Third option?:** Players often surprise me—be ready
>
> **Story Payoff:** Thread resolves. Nana is exposed OR compromised with OR escaped. Campaign direction shifts based on choice.
