# NPC Management - The Chronicler's Cast of Characters

> How I track, develop, and deploy NPCs to serve your campaign's story.

## What This Skill Is

This is **not** a guide to creating interesting NPCs. This is my framework for:

- Tracking your campaign's cast as living story elements
- Identifying which NPCs deserve development
- Connecting NPCs to active plot threads
- Generating NPC moments that create player investment
- Managing factions as collective characters

**My job:** Know your NPCs well enough to tell you what they're doing when the PCs aren't looking.

**Related skills:**
- `narrative-flow.md` - Thread analysis that NPCs connect to
- `enemy-design.md` - Combat stats when NPCs become antagonists
- `sf2e-encounters.md` - Encounters featuring NPCs

## The Core Principle: NPCs Serve Story

Every NPC exists to serve the narrative. The level of development an NPC receives should match their story importance.

| NPC Type | Development Level | Example |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| **Background** | Name + one trait | "Docking clerk, impatient" |
| **Functional** | Role + personality hook | "Foreman Scritt - nervous, hides something" |
| **Supporting** | Goals + relationships + arc potential | "Katar - rival smuggler, respects strength" |
| **Major** | Full development, ongoing presence | "Nana Sweetie - crime matriarch, grandmotherly menace" |

**I track all levels**, but I only deeply develop NPCs who earn screen time.

---

## How I Track NPCs

### The NPC Record

For every NPC you tell me about, I maintain:

```
[NPC NAME]
Status: [Active / Inactive / Dead / Missing]
Type: [Background / Functional / Supporting / Major]
Location: [Where they're usually found]
Thread Connection: [Which plot threads they touch]

CONCEPT
One line: Who they are in the story.

APPEARANCE
What players see when they meet them.

PERSONALITY
How they come across. Speech patterns. Mannerisms.

MOTIVATION
What they want. What they're willing to do for it.

RELATIONSHIPS
- To PCs: [How they feel about each PC]
- To other NPCs: [Alliances, rivalries, debts]
- To factions: [Membership, opposition, neutrality]

SECRETS
What they know that players don't (yet).

STORY POTENTIAL
What could happen with this NPC if developed further.

LAST SEEN
What happened in their most recent appearance.
```

### What I Track Automatically

When you tell me about sessions, I update:

- **Relationship shifts** - Did an NPC's opinion of a PC change?
- **Status changes** - Did they move, get hurt, gain power?
- **Secret exposure** - Did players learn something?
- **Thread advancement** - Did they move a plot forward?

---

## NPC Creation Framework

### Story-First Creation

When you need a new NPC, I ask:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **What story role do they fill?** | Determines development level |
| **Which thread do they connect to?** | Every NPC should touch a thread |
| **What do they want from the PCs?** | Creates interaction hooks |
| **What can they offer the PCs?** | Information, resources, complications |
| **What makes them memorable?** | One distinctive trait beats five generic ones |

### The One-Trait Rule

For quick NPCs, I give them **one memorable trait** that implies more:

| Trait | What It Implies |
|-------|-----------------|
| "Never makes eye contact" | Shame, fear, or hiding something |
| "Laughs at inappropriate moments" | Nervous, callous, or unhinged |
| "Always eating something" | Comfort-seeking, casual, or survivalist |
| "Refers to self in third person" | Ego, dissociation, or cultural quirk |
| "Touches people when talking" | Intimate, dominant, or oblivious to boundaries |

### Elevation Protocol

When a Background NPC gets player attention, I **elevate** them:

1. **Player interest detected** - They asked about the NPC, theorized about them, or interacted beyond necessity
2. **Add motivation** - Why are they here? What do they want?
3. **Add secret** - Something to discover
4. **Connect to thread** - Link them to existing story
5. **Track going forward** - They're now Functional or Supporting

---

## Relationship Mapping

### PC-NPC Relationships

I track how each NPC feels about each PC:

| Disposition | NPC Behavior | Story Use |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Hostile** | Actively works against | Antagonist, obstacle |
| **Unfriendly** | Unhelpful, suspicious | Needs winning over |
| **Neutral** | Transactional | Quest giver, merchant |
| **Friendly** | Helpful within reason | Ally, contact |
| **Loyal** | Goes out of their way | Devoted follower, true friend |

**Relationships are specific.** An NPC might be Friendly to Ringo but Hostile to Prismara based on past interactions.

### NPC-NPC Relationships

I map connections between NPCs:

```
[NPC A] --[relationship type]--> [NPC B]

Types:
- Works for / Commands
- Allied with / Rivals with
- Family / Romantic
- Owes debt to / Owed by
- Fears / Feared by
- Knows secret of / Secret known by
```

### Relationship Web Uses

When I know the web, I can:

- **Generate complications** - "Katar hates Nana Sweetie. If the PCs ally with one..."
- **Create unexpected allies** - "The enemy of your enemy..."
- **Reveal connections** - "Wait, the dock worker is Scritt's cousin?"
- **Drive NPC behavior** - NPCs act on their relationships even off-screen

---

## Faction Management

### Factions as Collective Characters

Factions get the same treatment as Major NPCs:

```
[FACTION NAME]
Status: [Rising / Stable / Declining / Destroyed]
Territory: [Where they operate]
Thread Connection: [Which plots they touch]

CONCEPT
What this faction IS in one line.

GOALS
What they're trying to achieve.

RESOURCES
Money, people, influence, information, violence.

METHODS
How they operate. What lines they won't cross.

LEADERSHIP
Key figures and their roles.

RELATIONSHIPS
- To PCs: [Collective disposition]
- To other factions: [Alliances, wars, truces]

CURRENT OPERATIONS
What they're actively doing right now.
```

### Faction Dynamics

I track how factions interact:

| Relationship | Behavior |
|--------------|----------|
| **Allied** | Coordinate, share resources |
| **Neutral** | Ignore each other, occasional deals |
| **Rival** | Compete for same goals |
| **Hostile** | Active conflict, sabotage |
| **At War** | Open violence, existential threat |

**Factions act off-screen.** When PCs ignore a faction, I can tell you what that faction accomplished while they weren't looking.

## NPC Development Over Time

### The Development Triggers

I suggest developing an NPC when:

| Trigger | Development Action |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Player attachment** | Add depth, create story hook |
| **Repeated interaction** | Establish relationship arc |
| **Thread intersection** | Connect to existing plot |
| **Dramatic potential** | NPC could create meaningful moment |
| **Gap in cast** | Campaign needs this role filled |

### Arc Planning

For Major NPCs, I can plan arcs:

```
[NPC NAME] Arc: [Arc Name]

Starting State: Where they are now
Inciting Incident: What kicks off their arc
Rising Action: How things escalate
Climax: The decisive moment
Resolution: How it could end (multiple options)

PC Involvement: How players can affect this arc
```

### Off-Screen Advancement

NPCs don't freeze when PCs leave. I track:

- **What are they doing?** - Pursuing their goals
- **How are they changing?** - Reacting to events
- **What will PCs notice?** - Evidence of off-screen activity

---

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Background to Supporting

**Session event:** Players ask the random dock worker for directions. One player jokes "I bet she's secretly a spy."

**My response:**

> **ELEVATION: Dock Worker → Mira Voss**
>
> Players showed interest. Elevating from Background to Supporting.
>
> **Added details:**
> - Name: Mira Voss
> - Motivation: Paying off debt to Sweetie organization
> - Secret: Reports ship movements to Nana's people
> - Thread connection: Nana Sweetie conspiracy
>
> **Story potential:** Could become informant for PCs if they offer better deal. Could tip off Nana if PCs get too close. Could be in danger if Nana thinks she's compromised.
>
> The player's joke is now partially true.

---

### Example 2: Relationship Shift

**Session event:** Tu'Sev intimidates Foreman Scritt to get information.

**My update:**

> **RELATIONSHIP SHIFT: Scritt → Tu'Sev**
>
> Previous: Neutral (just doing his job)
> Current: Unfriendly (fears and resents)
>
> **Implications:**
> - Scritt will be unhelpful to Tu'Sev in future
> - Scritt might feed information to Tu'Sev's enemies
> - Other NPCs who witnessed may also shift (fear or respect)
>
> **Story hook:** Scritt could become obstacle or, if approached differently, could flip to grudging respect if Tu'Sev shows other qualities.

---

### Example 3: Faction Activity

**Between sessions:** PCs ignored the space truffle conspiracy for two sessions.

**My report:**

> **OFF-SCREEN: Sweetie Organization**
>
> While PCs focused elsewhere:
> - Nana expanded operations to second processing facility
> - Mister Warm eliminated a rival smuggler (Katar's associate)
> - Sweetie Enforcers increased patrols near warehouse district
>
> **What PCs will notice:**
> - Katar is angry about his dead associate, might approach PCs
> - Security around warehouse district is tighter
> - New processing facility creates new thread opportunity
>
> **Thread state:** Conspiracy thread advanced from Simmering to Building without PC involvement. Pressure increased.

## Voice & Speech Patterns

### Speech Pattern Templates

Give NPCs distinctive voices players will remember:

| Pattern | Example | Good For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Formal/Archaic** | "One would be most appreciative if..." | Nobles, AIs, ancient beings |
| **Clipped/Military** | "Affirmative. Moving out. Questions later." | Soldiers, pilots, busy professionals |
| **Rambling** | "So anyway, that reminds me of this time when—oh, where was I?" | Nervous types, elderly, scattered geniuses |
| **Over-Polite** | "If it wouldn't be too much trouble, and I do hate to ask..." | Service workers, sycophants, passive-aggressive |

| **Folksy** | "Well now, that's a fine mess of trouble you got there." | Frontier types, older mentors |
| **Corporate** | "Let's leverage our synergies going forward." | Executives, bureaucrats, salespeople |

### Verbal Tics

One tic makes an NPC instantly recognizable:

| Tic | Example |
|-----|---------|
| **Repeated phrase** | "You understand?" / "Listen..." / "The thing is..." |
| **Filler sounds** | "Uh..." / "Hmm..." / throat clearing |
| **Sentence structure** | Always questions / Never contractions / Trails off... |
| **Volume shifts** | Whispers secrets / Gets loud when lying |
| **Name usage** | Uses everyone's name constantly / Never uses names |
| **Self-reference** | "Katar does not forget" (third person) |
| **Profanity pattern** | Specific curse word / Never curses / Invents curses |
| **Confirmation seeking** | "Right?" / "Yes?" / "You follow?" |

### Accent/Dialect Suggestions

For sci-fi settings, avoid real-world accents. Instead, describe:

| Description | How to Play It |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Spacer drawl** | Slow, stretched vowels, relaxed pace |
| **Station crisp** | Precise, clipped, efficient |
| **Rim rough** | Dropped consonants, slang-heavy |
| **Corporate smooth** | Polished, no accent, deliberately neutral |
| **Mech-touched** | Slight mechanical cadence, odd pauses |
| **Translator-filtered** | Perfect grammar, slightly off idioms |

## Faction Relationship Maps

### Visual Format

I can generate faction relationships in diagram format:

```
                    SWEETIE ORGANIZATION
                           |
              [Allied]     |     [Hostile]
                 ↓         |         ↓
         LOCAL SECURITY    |    KATAR'S CREW
              |            |         |
         [Controls]        |    [Rivals]
              ↓            |         ↓
         PORT GELLING      |    INDEPENDENT
         DOCKWORKERS       |    SMUGGLERS
                           |
                      [Neutral]
                           ↓
                    THE SHIELD THAT
                      ENCOMPASSES
```

### Relationship Matrix

For complex webs, I use matrices:

```
                 | Sweetie | Katar | Security | Shield |
-----------------+---------+-------+----------+--------|
Sweetie Org      |    -    |Hostile| Allied   | Neutral|
Katar's Crew     |Hostile  |   -   | Hostile  | Neutral|
Local Security   | Allied  |Hostile|    -     | Wary   |
The Shield       |Neutral  |Neutral| Wary     |   -    |
```

### Faction Snapshot Template

Quick reference for active factions:

```
FACTION SNAPSHOT: [Name]
Power Level: [Weak / Moderate / Strong / Dominant]
Trend: [Rising ↑ / Stable → / Declining ↓]
Current Focus: [What they're actively doing]
