## What Happened

### PROLOGUE - The Compound (Flashback)

The party investigated Bori's secret bedroom and witnessed the aftermath of his death.

**The Incomplete Awakening:**
- When Bori died mid-apotheosis, his ritual energy backlashed through connected cultists
- Temple guards began transforming in real-time - skin going translucent, bones reshaping, faces frozen mid-shift between expressions
- One guard's jaw unhinged, grey-pink tendrils pushing from his throat: *"...finally..."*
- Ribcages cracking outward, teeth falling out and regrowing wrong
- The transforming guard laughed, was grateful, cooperative - wanted to be *understood* and *seen*
- Helped wrap itself in its own limbs as the party bound it
- Made token escape attempts when unobserved, but mostly happy to be studied

**Posie's Friends Reaction:**
- Friends went frantic: "BAD. Seeds waking up. Seeds *blooming*."
- Explained the difference: "We are many-but-one. We build. We help. These seeds make *none-but-all*. The person goes away. Gets eaten."
- Revealed they remember "the bad time" - when the eating wouldn't stop
- Said Jemini has seeds but might be saveable - need someone who knows seeds: "The Midwife"
- **The brave friend explained to Posie:** *"We grow and change, but they grow wrong"* - the friends recognized the Newborn's transformations as similar to what *they* used to be before fragmentation
- **The Incomplete heard and responded** - taunting the brave friend, mentioning "THE MOTHER"
- This shocked the party: other PCs can't normally hear the friends, but the Incomplete could perceive them
- This is how the party learned the name for the circled deep space coordinates on Bori's map

**Jemini's Realization:**
- Initially hostile, refused to come: "That woman sent killers to murder my family"
- Watched the guard transform in horror
- *"That's... that's not... Bori said the Change was beautiful."*
- Looked at her own darkening veins: *"...that's me. That's going to be me."*
- Stopped resisting

**Tu'Sev's Investigations:**
- Examined the bound Incomplete in the lab - used Akashic Fount
- **Akashic Vision:** Saw his personal metaphor for the Record - rows and rows of card catalogues stretching infinitely. But the very last row was fuzzed out like static, gave him a headache. Something older than the Record.
- Felt a moment of the guard's experience: overwhelming joy, becoming something vast
- The guard's new eyes looked at him: *"...you almost understood..."*
- Investigated the arena where Bori fell - discovered it's Precursor construction, the cult built around it
- Found channels in the floor for something to flow, organic architecture, a sealed aperture in the ceiling
- Akashic vision: the ritual was originally *consensual*, reciprocal exchange - Bori was *taking*, not exchanging
- Voice from beneath: *"...why do they always leave..."*
- Discovered Precursor runes on the sealed door: "CONTAINMENT" and "DO NOT OPEN FROM OUTSIDE" and "THE CLEAN ONES GUARD WITHIN"
- Flash vision of figures in white sealing the door, something skittering behind them: *"If the Hollow get out—"*

**Prismara's Visions:**
- **Thread-sight activated** - started feeling resonance/connection between things, began seeing minor hallucinations
- Saw everyone connected by luminous threads
- Jemini's threads were *severed* from normal connections, dark new ones growing downward toward something below
- Realized the seeds don't isolate - they *rewire*. Connect you to a different network.
- **The Incomplete appeared as a void** to her connection-sense - a hole where threads should be
- Near the mural rubbing, felt the eye in the center *looking at her*: *"...there you are... the one who hears..."*
- Approaching the sealed door, her echolocation stopped working - void, not silence
- Examined the star chart with the circled deep space coordinates - felt all the threads converging toward that location
- Glimpsed the Newborn: vast body drifting between stars, eyes unfocused, inert but *present* - reality warping around it without it seeming to notice
- It noticed her. Didn't care. That was the worst part.
- **Killed the Incomplete** (reason unclear - possibly the void-nature disturbed her, or mercy)

**Party Theory:**
- Ringo: "Or they use it to spread themselves" (about the Drift connection)
- Posie's friends confirmed: the Newborn IS everywhere through the changed ones - one thing wearing many bodies, connected through the Drift

**Bori's Hidden Bedroom:**
- Found his real quarters (the spartan room was for show)
- Rich fabrics, comfortable bed, wine - hypocrisy of a cult leader
- Journals describing the Midwife: *"She did not want to help me... but a Midwife cannot refuse to nurture. It is her nature. I have bent that nature to my purpose."*
- *"She weeps when she works. I find I do not care."*
- Specimen jar with preserved communion flesh
- Star chart with three locations: compound (crossed out), Haunted Sif ("Primary"), encrypted deep space coordinates ("THE MOTHER")
- Prismeni research notes - Bori was trying to become what Prismara IS

**Shuttle Arrival:**
- Nana's shuttle arrived for extraction
- The Incomplete on the table laughed: *"...running away... but the garden comes with you now..."*
- Jemini asked how long she has before becoming *that*

---

### PORT GELLING - Nana's Debrief

**Jemini's Status:**
- Nana insisted Jemini stay at her compound "for observation" with Cassie
- Framed as hospitality, everyone knows it's leverage/containment
- *"The poor dear has been through so much. She needs rest, proper care."*

**The Debrief:**
- Ringo asked for Jemini to leave for private conversation
- Nana complied, then dropped part of the grandmother mask
- *"The girl is sick. I've seen that look before - on miners who spent too long in the deep shafts."*
- *"You didn't bring me back a rescued daughter. You brought me back a problem."*

**What They Told Her:**
- Party tried to hide the Newborn, the Midwife, and the Seeds
- Nana called them out - her people had already swept the compound
- Found the journals, the specimen jar, the sealed door
- *"I'm not angry, dears. People hold things back from me all the time."*
- *"But I expect complete information. Not because I'm cruel. Because I'm careful."*

**Prismara Showed the Jar:**
- Nana didn't flinch - leaned forward, studied it
- Connected it to the enhanced niaqui and the miners who "went strange"
- *"I had them removed, eventually. Too unsettling for business."*
- Asked about what's in the tunnels, what makes this

**The Lead to the Midwife:**
- Party revealed the Midwife can cure Jemini
- Nana immediately calculated: *"Which means the Midwife can also plant them. Properly."*
- Proposed a deal: party retrieves the Midwife, cures Jemini, in exchange for transport and Nana's continued friendship
- *"And when you bring the Midwife out, we have a conversation about what she knows."*

**The Goblins:**
- Nana mentioned "clearing" the goblin squatters at the compound
- Ringo passed word along but did not vouch for them
- The opening closed
- (Consequence: Guk and 12 goblins killed by Nana's crew the next morning - quick, efficient, professional)

**Payment:**
- 200 credits (Cassie's job) + 100 credits (Nana's bonus for intel) = 300 credits total

---

## Where We Left Off

- Party is at Port Gelling, ready to return to the compound and descend through the sealed door
- Jemini and Cassie are at Nana's compound as "guests"
- The Midwife is trapped in the cave below, caught between The Incomplete and The Hollow
- Jemini's timer is ticking (Stage 1, progressing toward Stage 2)
- The cave encounter is prepped and ready

---

## Key Revelations This Session

1. **The Incomplete** - Bori's death caused botched transformations in connected cultists, not successful ones
2. **The Hollow** - Ancient Precursor defense system, "the clean ones," still active in the tunnels
3. **The Seeds rewire, not isolate** - They connect you to the Newborn's network through the Drift
4. **The Newborn is physical** - Not a metaphor, an actual creature drifting inert between stars, reality warping around it without it seeming to notice
5. **The Precursor ritual was consensual** - Bori corrupted something that was originally reciprocal
6. **Nana verified their story** - She knows more now, filed it away for future use
7. **The goblins are dead** - Ringo didn't vouch, consequences followed

---

## Character Moments

**Ringo:**
- Made the hard choice not to vouch for the goblins
- Strategic calculation or letting it slide? Either way, Guk is dead

**Prismara:**
- Deepening connection to the cosmic horror
- The Newborn noticed her - and didn't care
- Thread-sight developing as new ability

**Tu'Sev:**
- Pushing the Akashic Fount hard, getting visions but also nosebleeds
- Discovered the Precursors predate the Record itself
- Felt the original ritual's purpose vs. Bori's corruption

**Posie:**
- Friends revealed their nature more clearly - Precursor nanites, remember "the bad time"
- They're scared of the seeds, recognize them as an opposing force

**Jemini:**
- Arc from hostile true believer to terrified victim
- Watched her "family" become monsters
- Now cooperating out of fear, not trust
