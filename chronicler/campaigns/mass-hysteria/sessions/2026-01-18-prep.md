---

## Bori's Secret Bedroom

### Existing Loot (in Foundry)
| Item | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Commercial Nano-edge Rapier | Weapon | Analog, deadly d8, disarm, finesse |
| Dizzying Anesthetic | Poison (L2) | Uncommon, injury poison |
| Shrink Spell Amp | Consumable (L3) | Magical |
| 10 gp | Treasure | - |

### Narrative Content

**The Room:** A spartan sleeping chamber that doubles as a study. The bed is an afterthought. The desk dominates. This isn't a cult leader's luxury - it's an obsessive's research station.

---

### 1. Bori's Research Journal

Battered journal, pages warped. Written in Vlakan with sections in proto-Akitonian (predates the Gap).

**Key Excerpts:**

> *"The lichen grows only where the fragment's influence reaches. It responds to blood. The ancients knew this - their murals show figures with opened palms standing before vast fungal gardens. They were FEEDING it."*

> *"I heard the voice again. Not words - impressions. Hunger. Patience. The lichen is not the source. The lichen is the MOUTH."*

> *"Three sites confirmed. Here. The spire on Haunted Sif. The deep station. The fragment's influence connects them all. A network. A NERVOUS SYSTEM."*

> *"Bori thought he was communing with a god. He was standing in front of a river and asking it to make him special."*

---

### 2. Prismeni Research (Prismara Hook)

A separate sheaf of notes, more recent. Bori was researching **Prismeni precognition**.

**What Prismara finds:**

> *"The Prismeni see without seeing. Their blindness is not a weakness - it is a FEATURE. The flesh-eyes are closed so the mind-eye can open. They glimpse the flow of possibility."*

> *"If the Newborn grants Change, could it grant this? Communion should allow perception across time, not just space. The tentacles carry sensation both ways."*

> *"The initiation must include sensory deprivation. Close the flesh-eyes. Open the mind-eye. Become a conduit for the Newborn's sight."*

**Implication:** Bori was trying to replicate what Prismara IS. He wanted her kind of sight, but twisted through the Newborn. She's exactly what he was trying to become.

---

### 3. The Mural Rubbing

Large paper sheet pinned to the wall - charcoal rubbing from the ruins below.

**The Image:** Tall, thin figures (unknown ancestry) standing in a circle around a central pit. Hands extended, palms bleeding. From the pit rise tendrils connecting to each figure's head. In the center: **a single massive eye.**

**If Tu'Sev uses Akashic Fount while touching it:**

> A moment of connection. Not memory - the Akashic doesn't record this civilization. They PREDATE the record. But something else stirs. A vast presence, patient as geology, notices Tu'Sev noticing it. For one terrible second, he understands: the Akashic Record isn't just a repository. It's a *lure.*

---

### 4. The Specimen Jar

Sealed jar containing fist-sized grey-green tissue. Label: **"FIRST COMMUNION - PRESERVED"**

Same material as the "flesh burrito" from Ringo.

**Examination (Medicine/Occult DC 16):**
- Not necrotic - *dormant*
- Cellular structure unlike any known organism
- Under magnification: thread-like structures resembling neurons
- **Twitches when exposed to blood**

**Implication:** The "initiation" planted these in cultists. They were being networked.

---

### 5. The Coordinates

Scrap of paper in the journal's spine:

1. **Antares Prime** - This compound (crossed out, marked "ACTIVE")
2. **Haunted Sif** - Matches Posie's Pull direction (marked "PRIMARY")
3. **[Encrypted]** - Computers DC 18 to decode: deep space coordinates between systems (marked "THE MOTHER")

---

## Jemini Confrontation

### The Setup

Jemini is Cassie's daughter. Severely brainwashed - cried when Bori died, even after transformation. She's not a captive. She's a true believer whose god just died.

### The Infection

Jemini was exposed to Seeds of Flesh during "initiation preparation." The Change is in her, but early. Catchable if they're paying attention.

### Lampshading Clues

| Clue | DC | What They Notice |
|------|-----|------------------|
| Subtle | Perception 14 | Veins look darker than they should |
| Moderate | Perception 16 | She scratches her forearms; faint raised lines remain, like something moving under skin |
| Obvious | Medicine 12 (touch) | Skin too warm. A pulse that doesn't match her heartbeat |
| Direct question | None | "I've been tired since initiation prep. Bori said I'd feel strange until I was *complete*." |

**If nobody bites:** Posie's friends react. They skitter away from Jemini, or toward her with unsettling curiosity. *"Friends say she has seeds in her."*

### The Timer

| Stage | Timeframe | Symptoms | Reversibility |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Stage 1 | Now - 48 hours | Subtle clues | Easy (Midwife) |
| Stage 2 | 48-72 hours | Visible vein darkening, fever, "hearing" something | Harder (Midwife + ritual) |
| Stage 3 | 72-96 hours | Flesh shifting, lost time, whispers back | Significant effort |
| Stage 4 | Beyond | Transformation begins. Becomes a vector. | May be too late |

### Read-Aloud

> The lashunta woman kneels where Bori fell. Ichor has soaked into her robes. She doesn't look up.
>
> "He was going to change everything. We were all going to become something *more*. And you stopped it."
>
> She finally looks up. Her eyes are dry, but something behind them has broken.
>
> "My mother sent you, didn't she."

It's not a question.

### Player Options

**"We're here to take you home."**

### The Cure Path

Finding Jemini's infection → investigating compound → discovering the cave → rescuing the Midwife → cure

---

## Port Gelling - Main Session

### Cassie Reunion (Keep Brief)

Cassie meets them at the shuttle. She's been pacing for hours.

> She sees Jemini first. Relief floods her face - then freezes. Something in how her daughter moves. How she won't meet her eyes.
>
> "Jemini. *Jemini.* You're safe. You're—"
>
> "Don't touch me."

**Seeds to plant:**
- Cassie immediately senses something wrong but doesn't know what
- *"She wasn't like this before she left. Cold, yes. Angry, yes. But not... empty."*
- If asked about their history: *"She said I was suffocating her. That I never let her be anything but my daughter."* (Guilt. Cassie pushed too hard; Jemini ran to someone who made her feel special.)
- Payment: Cassie pays as promised, but she's distracted. Keeps glancing at Jemini.
- **Lampshade for later:** *"I've seen that look before. On miners who spent too long near the deep shafts. The ones who heard things."* (Cassie knows more about Antares Prime's weirdness than she lets on.)

Don't linger here. Let the wrongness sit. Move to business.

---

### Port Gelling Business (Time Passes)

Things the party needs to deal with. Each takes 15-30 minutes and gives Jemini's timer a chance to tick.

**1. Nana Wants a Debrief**

Nana Sweetie didn't send that shuttle for free. She wants to know what happened at the compound - for her records, her security, and her curiosity.

> A Greeter Sweetiebot intercepts them within an hour of landing. Its smile is cheerful. Its message is not optional.
>
> "Nana Sweetie requests your presence at your earliest convenience! Which is now. She has questions about the Servants of the Unseen Horizon and their recent... dissolution."

**What Nana wants to know:**
- What was Bori actually doing? (She suspected drugs. Reality is worse.)
- Is the operation shut down or just disrupted?
- Are there loose ends that might cause her problems?

**What Nana is ESPECIALLY interested in:**
She's heard rumors of "enhanced niaqui" coming out of Bori's operation. Better high, longer duration, more addictive. If the party confirms this exists, she'll press for details.

> "Enhanced niaqui. My competitors have been whispering about it for months. If Bori cracked that formula... where was he getting his supply? What was the source?"

**CAMPAIGN TIMER:** If the party reveals the SOURCE of the enhanced niaqui (the Precursor ruins, the Newborn flesh, any of it), Nana files that information away. She's a businesswoman. She'll investigate.

- **Immediate:** Nothing visible. Nana thanks them for the intel.
- **Weeks later:** Nana sends her own people to the ruins.
- **Months later:** Enhanced niaqui begins appearing in Port Gelling's drug supply.
- **Long-term:** The drug spreads. People start changing. The Newborn's influence grows through commerce instead of cult.

The party doesn't know they're starting this timer. They just answered Nana's questions. Consequences come later.

**If they lie or stay vague:**
- Nana's suspicious but accepts it. "You're holding something back. That's fine. Everyone does."
- Timer doesn't start. She investigates on her own, slower, may never find the source.

**What Nana mentions (Ringo hook):**
> "I'll be sending a crew to secure the compound. Salvage what's useful, lock down what isn't. But first I'll need to clear out that band of space goblin hoodlums squatting near the entrance. Vermin."

This is Ringo's cue. He promised Guk he'd put in a good word with Nana - potentially get the goblins hired as guards for the Precursor ruin entrance instead of exterminated.

**If Ringo speaks up:**
- Diplomacy check to convince Nana (DC varies by argument)
- "They know the tunnels. They survived Bori. They're more useful as assets than corpses."
- Nana's skeptical but pragmatic. If Ringo vouches for them, she'll consider it.
- Success: *"Fine. YOUR goblins. Your responsibility. If they cause me problems, I'm billing you."*

**If Ringo stays silent:**
- Guk and his crew get "cleared out" off-screen
- Consequence for broken promise - could come back later

**What Nana might offer:**
- Payment bonus if the intel is good
- Future work ("I may have other problems that need your particular skills")
- A warning: *"The deep ruins are older than anyone remembers. People who dig there tend to find things. Things that find them back."*

**Seed for later:** Nana's been on Antares Prime a long time. She knows the ruins are dangerous. She doesn't know the details, but she's survived by knowing when not to ask questions.

---

**2. Loot Identification**

The party has items from Bori's stash. Some need identification or appraisal.

| Item | Who Can Help | Time |
|------|--------------|------|
| Commercial Nano-edge Rapier | Katar (Kill) or Pawnshop | Quick - standard item |
| Dizzying Anesthetic (poison) | "Doctor" Fowl or Doctor Bobo | 15 min - uncommon |
| Shrink Spell Amp | Asimov or Oddz'n'Endz | 20 min - magical item |
| Specimen Jar (flesh sample) | ??? | Nobody wants to touch this |

**The Specimen Jar problem:**
If they try to get the preserved communion flesh identified:
- Doctor Bobo: *"I don't... I don't want to open that. I can see it moving. It's in a sealed jar and I can see it MOVING."*
- Asimov: *"This is biological. Far outside my expertise. And frankly, my comfort zone."*
- Cog: *"Fascinating. Horrifying. But fascinating. I'd need proper lab equipment to analyze it. And I'm not sure I want to."*

The jar is a mystery they carry with them. Nobody in Port Gelling can help. Maybe the Midwife can explain it later.

---

**3. Cult Survivor**

Not everyone in the Servants of the Unseen Horizon was at the compound. Some were in town. Running errands. Recruiting. Living double lives.

One of them finds the party.

> A young human woman approaches. Nervous. Keeps looking over her shoulder.
>
> "You're the ones who... who stopped Bori. I saw you leave with Jemini."
>
> She's shaking.
>
> "I want out. I never... he said we'd transcend. Become something greater. But I saw what happened to Vell. She started changing and she was so *happy* about it and then she wasn't Vell anymore."
>
> "Please. Is there somewhere safe? Someone who can help me disappear?"

**Her name:** Mira. Low-level cultist. Believed the pitch, got cold feet when the transformations started.

**What she knows:**
- The "initiation prep" involved something being put inside you. She refused at the last minute.
- Bori talked about "the source" in the caves. Guards went there regularly.
- There are maybe 3-4 other cultists still in Port Gelling. Scared. Hiding. Waiting to see what happens.

**What she wants:**
- Safe passage off-world, or
- Assurance the remaining cultists won't come after her, or
- Just someone to tell her she's not damned for what she almost became

**Resolution options:**
- Point her to Chk Chk (discrete, won't ask questions)
- Take her to Cassie (who might have feelings about cult members)
- Tell her to figure it out herself (cold but valid)

This takes time. And while they deal with Mira, Jemini sits in the corner, scratching her arms.

---

**4. Ship Status (If Applicable)**

If the party has a ship or ongoing vehicle concerns:

> B3rt0 chirps an alert. The shuttle's port thruster is running hot. Nothing critical, but it needs attention before any long-haul travel.
>
> Estimated repair time: 2-3 hours. Cost: Minimal if they do it themselves, 50 credits if they pay someone.

This is purely mechanical downtime, but it grounds the session in practicality and gives an excuse for them to be stuck in Port Gelling while things develop.

---

### Jemini Deteriorating (Beats to Drop)

Jemini is Stage 1 when they arrive. Over the session, she progresses toward Stage 2. Drop these beats throughout Port Gelling scenes:

**Early (Stage 1 - Subtle):**
- She's quiet. Withdrawn. Normal for someone whose world just collapsed.
- Picks at her food. Says she's not hungry.
- If anyone's watching: she scratches her forearms absently. Doesn't seem to notice she's doing it.

**Middle (Stage 1 → 2 Transition):**
- Fever. She's warm to the touch. *"I'm fine. Just tired."*
- Veins on her arms look darker. Could be lighting. Could be imagination.
- She's muttering. Caught mid-sentence: *"...almost complete..."* then snaps out of it. *"What? I didn't say anything."*
- Stares at nothing. When asked what she's looking at: *"The pattern. Don't you see it?"* There's nothing there.

**Late (Stage 2 - Visible):**
- The veins are definitely darker. Visible through her skin like dark rivers.
- She flinches from bright light.
- If touched, her pulse is wrong. Too fast. Or maybe there's a second rhythm underneath.
- *"He said I'd feel strange until I was complete. I think... I think I'm almost there."* She sounds *happy* about it.

**If they take her to Doctor Bobo:**

> Doctor Bobo's six hands move with unusual stillness as she examines Jemini. Her usual manic energy is gone.
>
> "This isn't... this isn't sickness. This isn't bacteria or virus or toxin. There's something *in* her. Growing. I can see it moving under her skin."
>
> She looks at the party. For once, she's not smiling.
>
> "I don't know how to help her. This isn't medicine. This is something else."

---

### Hooks to the Cave

**Primary: Bori's Journal (From Prologue)**
The coordinates in the journal's spine. One points to the compound (crossed out), one to Haunted Sif, one encrypted. But there are references to *"the source"* and *"the vessel that tends the garden."*

> *"She resists, but her function overrides her will. The Midwife cannot refuse to nurture. It is her nature. I have bent that nature to our purpose."*

If they connect the dots: Bori had someone captive who could help. She's still there.

**Color: Posie's Friends React (Opposition, Not Guidance)**
When near Jemini, Posie's friends act strange - but not helpful:

> They won't go near her. Every time Posie gets close to Jemini, the friends retreat to the far side of her body, clustering away from the lashunta like she's radioactive.
>
> "Friends don't like her. Say she has... wrongness. Growing wrongness. They're scared."

This reinforces that something is deeply wrong with Jemini. The friends sense the Newborn's influence and want nothing to do with it - Precursor nanites vs. Newborn forces are opposed. They can confirm she's infected but won't point toward a cure.

**Backup (DM Hand-Hold): Jemini Herself**
If they're stuck, in a lucid moment:

> "He talked about it. The source. Something in the caves that gave him the gift. He said it didn't want to help him but it couldn't refuse. Its nature wouldn't let it."
>
> "He laughed about that. Trapping something and making it serve him."
>
> "I don't want to die. I don't want to become... please. *Please* help me."

---

### Alternate Paths (If They Don't Pursue the Cave)

**Leave Jemini to Her Fate**
- Cassie's reaction: Devastating. *"I hired you to save her. You brought her back and you're going to let her become... that?"*
- Jemini progresses to Stage 3 by session end. Stage 4 by next session. Becomes a recurring problem/tragedy.
- Dark but valid character choice. Consequences should be real.

**Find Another Cure**
- Doctor Bobo: Can slow progression but not stop it. Buys time (24 hours per treatment).
- Oddz'n'Endz: *"We've got weird stuff, but nothing that weird. Sorry."*
- The Pawnshop Trio: Jim frowns. *"I've seen a lot come through here. Never seen anything that cures... whatever that is."*
- Dead ends that point back to the cave.

**Pursue Other Coordinates**
- Haunted Sif: Posie's pull destination. Major journey, not a quick trip. Could be next arc.
- Encrypted coordinates: Computers DC 18 reveals deep space location marked "THE MOTHER." Way beyond current scope.
- Validates the larger conspiracy exists but doesn't solve immediate problem.

**Deal with Port Gelling Business**
- Shopping, selling loot, downtime
- Can fill time but Jemini's clock is ticking
- Every scene in town, remind them she's getting worse

---

### Port Gelling NPC Moments (Optional Color)

Drop these in during downtime or shopping:

**Herman's Pitch**
> A large bald man with an impressive waxed mustache blocks their path, four squoxes draped across his shoulders.
>
> "Friends! You look like people who need companionship! Eight-legged, furry companionship! This one—" *lifts a squox* "—really likes you. I can tell."
>
> The squox looks deeply indifferent.

**Fr3d Patrol**
> An Observer-Class Security Robot walks past, humming tunelessly. It pauses, optical sensors fixed on the party for slightly too long.
>
> It nods—a distinctly non-standard robot behavior—and continues on.
>
> A passing merchant waves. "Hey Fr3d!"
>
> The robot doesn't respond. It never does.

**Todd's Observation**
If they drink at Gelling Bar and Grill:

> Todd pours without asking what they want. Somehow it's exactly right.
>
> He glances toward where Jemini sits, staring at nothing.
>
> "Seen that look before." He wipes a glass. "Knew a guy who worked the deep ruins. Came back different. Kept talking about patterns. Said he could see how everything connected."
>
> "He went back. Didn't come out."
>
> Todd shrugs. Not his problem. But he said it anyway.

**Jim at the Pawnshop**
If they bring loot to appraise or sell:

> While Krull argues loudly about fair pricing and Shuuthul counters with depreciation statistics, Jim quietly examines their finds.
>
> "This is good stuff. Where'd you get it?" He doesn't press. Just curious.
>
> He notices them glancing back toward the door. Toward Jemini.
>
> "You folks look like you're carrying something heavy. Not the gear. Something else."
>
> He doesn't offer advice. Just acknowledgment. Sometimes that's enough.

## Precursor Ruins - Cave

### Scene Purpose

The cave is the SOURCE of the Newborn flesh Bori cultivated. An eggshell fragment from the Newborn's passage. The Midwife is being held prisoner by Bori's remaining guards, forced to produce Seeds of Flesh.

### Tokens on Map

| Token | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 3× Jinsul Trooper | Guards holding the Midwife |
| Free Captain Gunner | Their leader - running the operation |
| Presulea Midwife | PRISONER - can cure Jemini |
| Orocoran | Wildlife drawn to fragment |
| 2× Ravenous Drake | Wildlife |
| Zitteroc | Wildlife |

### The Midwife Encounter

When rescued, she's not hostile. She's been *misused*.

---

## Vessel-of-Necessary-Change (The Midwife)

### What She Is

A Midwife of the Newborn from Aucturn. She *tends* to Change - nurtures transformation, ensures it proceeds correctly. Gardener, not general. Hospice worker for the old form, doula for the new.

An aberration with the **holy** trait. The Newborn is not evil - it is a cosmic principle. Its servants can be sacred.

### Appearance

> Something unfolds from the corner. Proportions wrong - limbs bending in too many places. Skin like translucent membrane over something luminous. Eyes not where you expect them.
>
> And yet there is something *gentle* in how she moves. Deliberate. Careful. Like a nurse around a sleeping patient.
>
> When she speaks, her voice sounds like it's coming from inside your own chest.

**Physical:** Translucent membrane-skin, faintly luminescent. Multiple joints. Eyes distributed across form. Tentacles that move with surprising delicacy. Smells like ozone, copper, and new growth.

### Voice & Mannerisms

- Speaks slowly, choosing words carefully
- Medical/biological metaphors
- "Becoming" and "completion" instead of transformation
- Never says "monster" or "corruption" - all Change is sacred
- Alien phrasing: "Your flesh is *restless*" instead of "You seem agitated"

### Sample Dialogue

**On her captivity:**
> "I do not *make* these seeds. That is not my function. I *tend*. What they did to me here was..."
>
> *A sound like cracking ice.*
>
> "Imagine being forced to perform surgery with a hammer. Again. And again."

**On the Newborn:**
> "The Newborn does not *want*. It simply *is*. A river does not want to reach the sea. A fire does not want to spread. These are merely... their natures."

**On Jemini:**
> "Your friend carries seeds planted without care. Without *intention*. They will bloom wrong. I can prune. Redirect. But only if she allows it."

**On Bori:**
> "He believed he was communing with a god. He was correct, in a sense. But he mistook *attention* for *affection*. The Newborn noticed him the way you might notice an insect walking across your hand. He asked to be changed. It obliged. It did not ask what he wished to *become*."

### What She Wants

| Request | Offers |
|---------|--------|
| Freedom | Gratitude, answers, non-hostility |
| Cure Jemini | "A kindness I can provide" (requires Jemini's consent) |
| Leave fragment alone | Information about the Newborn, Precursors, larger picture |
| Let her tend it properly | Future ally, contact between worlds |

### What She Knows

**The Newborn:**
> "The 'eggshell' is not a remnant of birth - it is a remnant of *passage*. The Newborn moved through this place once. What remains is afterbirth. Potent. Sacred. Very dangerous to those who do not understand."

**The Precursors:**
> "The old ones who built these tunnels understood. They did not worship the Newborn, but they *respected* it. They built channels - ways for Change to flow without flooding. Your cult leader found the channels and tried to dam them. Redirect the flow into himself."
>
> *A sound like wind through hollow bones.*
>
> "Rivers do not like being dammed."

**The Seeds:**
> "A seed is not a weapon. A seed is a *possibility*. Planted with intention, tended with care, it becomes something beautiful. Planted carelessly..."
>
> *She gestures at the cave.*
>
> "You have seen what it becomes."

**Haunted Sif:**
> "The old ones built channels in many places. The world your small friend seeks... there are channels there too. Very old. Very powerful. Be careful what flows through them."

### Curing Jemini

- Requires Jemini's **consent** (she may refuse - "It's all I have left of him")
- Not painless - the seeds must be *drawn out*
- Jemini will feel everything being taken from her

### Stats Reference

Level 4, HP 76, AC 18. Will +13, Fort +10, Ref +7. Tentacle (agile, finesse, reach 10), Shimmering Ray. Spells: Heal, Cellular Stimulant, Verdant Code, Soul Surge. Nourishing Aura (passive), Vital Siphon (reaction), Return to Aucturn (teleport).

## Prismara's Sensory Disturbances (Building Throughout Session)

Prismara "sees" through echolocation - sound, vibration, texture, echo. As the session progresses toward the fragment, her senses start lying to her. Drop these in escalating order.

### Stage 1: Subtle (Bedroom Investigation)
*"Your clicks come back... wrong. For just a moment, the room felt bigger than it is. Like there was more space behind that wall than there should be."*

*"You taste copper in the air. Just for a second. Then it's gone."*

### Stage 2: Unsettling (Jemini Confrontation)
*"When Jemini speaks, you hear an echo that doesn't match her mouth. Like something else is speaking a half-second behind her, in a frequency just below hearing."*

*"Your echolocation paints the room normally - except there's a shape in the corner that wasn't there before. When you ping again, it's gone."*

### Stage 3: Wrong (Approaching the Cave)
*"The tunnel ahead should be empty. Your clicks say it is. But you FEEL something. Massive. Patient. Your echolocation insists nothing is there. Your fur says otherwise."*

*"For one terrible moment, every sound in the cave comes back as the same thing: a heartbeat. The walls. The dripping water. Your own footsteps. All one rhythm."*

### Stage 4: The Fragment (Just Before Discovery)
*"Your echolocation stops working. Not silence - VOID. Your clicks go out and don't come back. You are blind in a way you've never been blind before. And in that darkness, something is breathing."*

Then trigger the full vision when they find/touch the fragment.

---

## Prismara's Vision

### Setup: Bori's Research (found in bedroom)

Bori was studying Prismeni precognition. He wanted to replicate it through Newborn communion - sight across time, not just space. He was trying to become what she IS.

This makes her feel targeted. Even if he didn't know she was coming, she's exactly what he wanted to be.

### Trigger

At a climactic moment (GM discretion - perhaps touching the fragment, or during the Jemini cure, or in combat).

### The Vision

**Describe through SENSES, not sight. She's blind. Her visions are sensory impressions, not images.**

---

*It starts with drowning.*

*Not water. The viscosity is wrong. Heavier. She's in an ocean but something is OFF. It doesn't flow like water should. It clings. It pulls.*

*A wave engulfs her—*

---

*Flash. Heat against her fur. Metallic tang in the air. A place she doesn't recognize. Shouting in a language she almost understands.*

*Flash. Cold stone under her paws. Ancient. Something vast sleeping beneath her.*

*Flash. The hum of a ship's engine, but wrong - too many harmonics. Too alive.*

*Flash. Wind that tastes like copper. A world she's never been to.*

*Flash. Flash. Flash.*

*Planets. Places. Possibilities spinning off like sparks from a fire.*

---

*And then Posie.*

*She feels Posie charging at something. Determination like a bright thread. And then—*

*Posie SHATTERS.*

*Not dies. Splinters. A million fragments, each one a version of this moment, each one a different ending. Some triumphant. Some tragic. Some incomprehensible. Posie as a single point becoming infinite lines, spreading outward, each one a choice, a consequence, a—*

---

*It stops.*

*The chaos freezes. The fragments hang suspended.*

*And then it all... shifts.*

---

*She's floating. Weightless. The sensory noise is gone. There's only stillness.*

*And something in front of her.*

*She can't see it - she's never seen anything - but she FEELS it. Vast. Impossibly vast. A body that stretches beyond her ability to perceive, like trying to comprehend the size of a planet by touching a single grain of sand.*

*But the eye. She feels the eye.*

*Colossal. Ancient. And yet...*

*New.*

*Newly born.*

*The pupil moves. For the first time in its very brief existence, it focuses on something.*

*On her.*

---

*She snaps back.*

### Aftermath

- She's shaking, disoriented
- The vision is CONFUSING now - she doesn't understand what she saw
- Don't explain it. Let it sit.
- This pays off at the END of the campaign when they reach the climax

### Player Reaction

If Prismara's player asks what it meant:
- "You don't know. It felt like drowning in something that wasn't water. You saw - felt - places you've never been. Posie breaking into infinite pieces. And at the end... something saw you."
- "Something that had never looked at anything before."

## Quick Reference - Session Beats

1. **Bedroom** - Loot, Tu'Sev hooks, Prismara finds Bori's research on Prismeni
2. **Jemini** - Confrontation, notice the infection clues
3. **Cave** - Combat with guards, rescue Midwife (required for cure)
4. **Cure** - Midwife helps Jemini (if consented)
5. **Vision** - Triggered at climactic moment for Prismara

### Timing Estimate (~4 hours)
| Beat | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Bedroom | 30-45 min | Investigation, journals, Tu'Sev Akashic moment |
| Jemini | 30-60 min | Emotional RP, noticing infection |
| Cave | 60-90 min | Combat + Midwife rescue |
| Midwife/Cure | 30-45 min | Lore, negotiation, cure ritual |
| Vision | 10-15 min | Prismara's climactic moment |

**Flow:** Each beat leads to the next. Jemini's infection → need Midwife → cave is required. Only "optional" if they abandon her.

## Lore Notes (Background - don't dump on players)

### The Precursors
- Ancient biotech civilization
- Grey goo apocalypse - their nanites almost consumed everything
- Last-ditch solution: fragment the nanites into single-purpose "personalities"
- Scattered across Antares system: growth (Sauriels-Garden), travel/aid (Posie's friends), etc.
- The fragmentation halted the apocalypse but left the system seeded with dormant tech

### The Newborn
- Not evil, just Change incarnate
- Doesn't want anything - it simply IS
- Where its presence touches, transformation happens
- Bori mistook attention for affection
- The eggshell fragment is "afterbirth" from its passage through this place

### The Nanite Connection
- Posie's friends are Precursor nanites (travel/aid fragment)
- They received the Drift Signal and went looking for "help"
- The Mother Swarm on Haunted Sif is likely another fragment (coordination? communication?)
- If fragments reunite... they may regain adaptability. Grey goo 2.0?
- The Newborn's presence may be corrupting the original Precursor programming
