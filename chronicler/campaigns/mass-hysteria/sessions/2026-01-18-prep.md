# Session Prep - January 18, 2026

## Session Overview

**Structure:**
- **Prologue (Flashback):** Quick investigation before extraction - bedroom, Jemini confrontation. 20-30 min.
- **Main Session:** Port Gelling. Cassie reunion, Jemini deteriorates, party investigates/decides next steps.
- **Act 3 (If they pursue cure):** Cave exploration, Midwife rescue, Prismara's vision.

**Starting Point:** The shuttle Nana sent has just arrived back at Port Gelling. The party has Jemini. They have loot. They have questions. And something is wrong with Cassie's daughter.

---

## Bori's Secret Bedroom

### Existing Loot (in Foundry)
| Item | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Commercial Nano-edge Rapier | Weapon | Analog, deadly d8, disarm, finesse |
| Dizzying Anesthetic | Poison (L2) | Uncommon, injury poison |
| Shrink Spell Amp | Consumable (L3) | Magical |
| 10 gp | Treasure | - |

### Narrative Content

**The Room:** A spartan sleeping chamber that doubles as a study. The bed is an afterthought. The desk dominates. This isn't a cult leader's luxury - it's an obsessive's research station.

---

### 1. Bori's Research Journal

Battered journal, pages warped. Written in Vlakan with sections in proto-Akitonian (predates the Gap).

**Key Excerpts:**

> *"The lichen grows only where the fragment's influence reaches. It responds to blood. The ancients knew this - their murals show figures with opened palms standing before vast fungal gardens. They were FEEDING it."*

> *"I heard the voice again. Not words - impressions. Hunger. Patience. The lichen is not the source. The lichen is the MOUTH."*

> *"Three sites confirmed. Here. The spire on Haunted Sif. The deep station. The fragment's influence connects them all. A network. A NERVOUS SYSTEM."*

> *"Bori thought he was communing with a god. He was standing in front of a river and asking it to make him special."*

---

### 2. Prismeni Research (Prismara Hook)

A separate sheaf of notes, more recent. Bori was researching **Prismeni precognition**.

**What Prismara finds:**

> *"The Prismeni see without seeing. Their blindness is not a weakness - it is a FEATURE. The flesh-eyes are closed so the mind-eye can open. They glimpse the flow of possibility."*

> *"If the Newborn grants Change, could it grant this? Communion should allow perception across time, not just space. The tentacles carry sensation both ways."*

> *"The initiation must include sensory deprivation. Close the flesh-eyes. Open the mind-eye. Become a conduit for the Newborn's sight."*

**Implication:** Bori was trying to replicate what Prismara IS. He wanted her kind of sight, but twisted through the Newborn. She's exactly what he was trying to become.

---

### 3. The Mural Rubbing

Large paper sheet pinned to the wall - charcoal rubbing from the ruins below.

**The Image:** Tall, thin figures (unknown ancestry) standing in a circle around a central pit. Hands extended, palms bleeding. From the pit rise tendrils connecting to each figure's head. In the center: **a single massive eye.**

**If Tu'Sev uses Akashic Fount while touching it:**

> A moment of connection. Not memory - the Akashic doesn't record this civilization. They PREDATE the record. But something else stirs. A vast presence, patient as geology, notices Tu'Sev noticing it. For one terrible second, he understands: the Akashic Record isn't just a repository. It's a *lure.*

---

### 4. The Specimen Jar

Sealed jar containing fist-sized grey-green tissue. Label: **"FIRST COMMUNION - PRESERVED"**

Same material as the "flesh burrito" from Ringo.

**Examination (Medicine/Occult DC 16):**
- Not necrotic - *dormant*
- Cellular structure unlike any known organism
- Under magnification: thread-like structures resembling neurons
- **Twitches when exposed to blood**

**If someone tries to touch the jar (Posie nearby):**
> The friends go *berserk*. They swarm away from the jar, climbing to Posie's far shoulder, skittering in agitation.
>
> "Friends say NO. Bad seeds. *Wrong* seeds. Don't let it touch. Don't let it *plant*."

**If they persist and open/touch the tissue:**
> Thread-thin tendrils extend from the tissue, wrapping around your fingers before you can pull away. They don't hurt. They *pulse* - matching your heartbeat, then trying to *change* it.
>
> You yank your hand back. The tendrils snap. But for a moment, you felt something *wanting* to grow inside you.

Reflex DC 16 to pull away in time. Failure: Fort DC 18 or take 1d6 mental damage and gain a faint dark mark on the palm that fades over 24 hours. The mark is cosmetic but deeply unsettling - and Posie's friends won't come near that hand until it fades.

**Implication:** The "initiation" planted these in cultists. They were being networked.

---

### 5. The Coordinates

Scrap of paper in the journal's spine:

1. **Antares Prime** - This compound (crossed out, marked "ACTIVE")
2. **Haunted Sif** - Matches Posie's Pull direction (marked "PRIMARY")
3. **[Encrypted]** - Computers DC 18 to decode: deep space coordinates between systems (marked "THE MOTHER")

---

## Jemini Confrontation

### The Setup

Jemini is Cassie's daughter. Severely brainwashed - cried when Bori died, even after transformation. She's not a captive. She's a true believer whose god just died.

### The Infection

Jemini was exposed to Seeds of Flesh during "initiation preparation." The Change is in her, but early. Catchable if they're paying attention.

### Lampshading Clues

| Clue | DC | What They Notice |
|------|-----|------------------|
| Subtle | Perception 14 | Veins look darker than they should |
| Moderate | Perception 16 | She scratches her forearms; faint raised lines remain, like something moving under skin |
| Obvious | Medicine 12 (touch) | Skin too warm. A pulse that doesn't match her heartbeat |
| Direct question | None | "I've been tired since initiation prep. Bori said I'd feel strange until I was *complete*." |

**If nobody bites:** Posie's friends react. They skitter away from Jemini, or toward her with unsettling curiosity. *"Friends say she has seeds in her."*

### The Timer

| Stage | Timeframe | Symptoms | Reversibility |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Stage 1 | Now - 48 hours | Subtle clues | Easy (Midwife) |
| Stage 2 | 48-72 hours | Visible vein darkening, fever, "hearing" something | Harder (Midwife + ritual) |
| Stage 3 | 72-96 hours | Flesh shifting, lost time, whispers back | Significant effort |
| Stage 4 | Beyond | Transformation begins. Becomes a vector. | May be too late |

### Read-Aloud

> You find the lashunta woman in the compound's common area. She's sitting alone, staring at nothing. The other cultists have fled or been dealt with. She didn't run.
>
> When she hears you approach, she doesn't look up.
>
> "He's gone. I felt it. The connection just... stopped."
>
> Her voice is flat. Empty.
>
> "He was going to change everything. We were all going to become something *more*. And now he's just... meat. Like the rest of us."
>
> She finally looks up. Her eyes are dry, but something behind them has broken.
>
> "My mother sent you, didn't she."

It's not a question.

### Player Options

**"We're here to take you home."**
- Diplomacy DC 22
- Critical Success: Comes, but silent/empty

- Failure: "That *woman* sent killers to murder my family."
- Critical Failure: Attacks or flees

**"Your mother loves you."**
- Diplomacy DC 18, shifts conversation
- Opens a wound - history between Jemini and Cassie

- *"She loves the daughter she wanted. Not the one she got."*

**"Bori was going to sacrifice everyone - including you."**
- Society/Occultism DC 16
- Success: Flicker of doubt. "No... he said we would all transcend..."
- Failure: "LIES. Just like her - trying to make me small again."

**"What did Bori promise YOU?"**
- No check - information gathering
- She wanted to matter. To be part of something vast.
- *"He said I had potential. That the Newborn saw something in me."*

**Force/Restrain**

- She's a civilian - mechanically easy, narratively devastating
- If restrained: goes limp, stops responding entirely

**Leave her**
- Won't survive long alone
- Or becomes a recurring problem
- Cassie: "You LEFT her there?!"

### The Cure Path

Finding Jemini's infection → investigating compound → discovering the cave → rescuing the Midwife → cure

---

## Port Gelling - Main Session

### Cassie Reunion (Keep Brief)

Cassie meets them at the shuttle. She's been pacing for hours.

> She sees Jemini first. Relief floods her face - then freezes. Something in how her daughter moves. How she won't meet her eyes.
>
> "Jemini. *Jemini.* You're safe. You're—"
>
> "Don't touch me."

**Seeds to plant:**
- Cassie immediately senses something wrong but doesn't know what
- *"She wasn't like this before she left. Cold, yes. Angry, yes. But not... empty."*
- If asked about their history: *"She said I was suffocating her. That I never let her be anything but my daughter."* (Guilt. Cassie pushed too hard; Jemini ran to someone who made her feel special.)
- Payment: Cassie pays as promised, but she's distracted. Keeps glancing at Jemini.
- **Lampshade for later:** *"I've seen that look before. On miners who spent too long near the deep shafts. The ones who heard things."* (Cassie knows more about Antares Prime's weirdness than she lets on.)

Don't linger here. Let the wrongness sit. Move to business.

---

### CASSIE'S HIDDEN KNOWLEDGE

**What Cassie knows (and hasn't shared):**

Cassie was among the first wave of settlers when the Drift Beacon opened Antares to travel - less than five years ago. In that short time, she's seen things go wrong. Fast. People don't come to a newly-opened system unless they're running from something or chasing something. A lot of both happened here.

**The Early Days:**
When the system first opened, there was a rush. Prospectors, researchers, opportunists. A lot of them didn't understand what they were getting into.

> "You know how long this system has been cut off? Before the Beacon, nobody could get here. Nobody even knew it was HERE. And then suddenly we could Drift in, and everyone wanted a piece of it."
>
> *She doesn't look at the party when she says this.*
>
> "Some of the early survey teams went into the ruins. Pre-Gap structures - older than anyone could date. Most of them came back fine. Most."
>
> *A long pause.*
>
> "The ones who didn't come back fine... they'd talk about patterns. Rhythms. One guy said the walls were breathing. We thought it was gas exposure. Bad air in sealed spaces."

**If pressed (Diplomacy DC 16):**

> "There's something under this planet. I don't know what. I don't WANT to know. But it's been here since before the Gap. Maybe since before there was anyone to remember."
>
> "Jemini's father... he was one of the first xenoarchaeologists to arrive. Came here specifically to study the pre-Gap ruins. That's how we met."
>
> *Her voice hardens.*
>
> "He was only here six months before he started changing. Not physically - just... his priorities. He'd stay out at the ruins for days. Started talking about 'connections' and 'the pattern.' And then one day he walked into the desert."
>
> "I was pregnant with Jemini. He never even knew."
>
> *Bitter laugh.*
>
> "I swore I'd never let my daughter get curious about the same things. Look how well that worked."

**The Ruins:**
Everyone knows there are old structures on Antares Prime. That's why researchers came. But Cassie knows which ones to avoid.

> "There are at least three sites that the survey teams found. Bori's compound is built near one - I don't think that's a coincidence. There's another about fifty klicks east - completely collapsed, but you can see the outline from the air. And there's one..."
>
> *She hesitates.*
>
> "When Nana was building Port Gelling, the construction crews hit something. Old. Sealed. She had them build around it. Whether she knows what's down there, I couldn't say. But the foundations of this port go down farther than they should."

**If they ask about Jemini's father specifically:**

> "Talven. His name was Talven. He arrived on the same transport I did - one of the first science teams."
>
> *A sad smile.*
>
> "He was brilliant. Obsessive, but brilliant. He believed the ruins were connected somehow - that they were all part of the same structure, spread across the whole system. Even without the Drift access to prove it."
>
> "Before he left... before he walked away... he told me something. Said he'd finally understood what the ruins were FOR."
>
> *She shakes her head.*
>
> "He said they were 'channels.' For something to flow through. Something that wasn't supposed to flow anymore, but was starting to again."
>
> "Four years ago, I thought he was raving. Now I'm not so sure."

**Why she hasn't told anyone:**
- It's only been a few years but it feels like a lifetime
- Talking about it feels like inviting it in
- She's terrified that if Jemini learns about her father's obsession, she'll follow the same path
- *"Some knowledge isn't worth having. Some questions are better left unasked."*

**GM Notes:**
- Cassie's knowledge is fragmentary - but she's been here since nearly the beginning
- Her husband Talven may have discovered the Precursor truth - the "channels" are real
- His fate is deliberately vague - he may be dead, transformed, or still out there somewhere
- Jemini never knew her father - this is new information to her too
- The ruins under Port Gelling are a potential future plot point - Nana built there deliberately?

Don't info-dump this. Let it come out naturally if players ask the right questions. Cassie won't volunteer any of it - she has to be pushed.

### Port Gelling Business (Time Passes)

Things the party needs to deal with. Each takes 15-30 minutes and gives Jemini's timer a chance to tick.

**WHERE IS JEMINI?**

Nana insists Jemini stay at her compound "for observation." Cassie is allowed to stay with her. This is framed as hospitality, but everyone knows what it really is: leverage, containment, and information gathering.

> "The poor dear has been through so much. She needs rest, proper care, somewhere safe. I have guest quarters - quite comfortable. Her mother can stay with her, of course."
>
> *The smile doesn't waver.*
>
> "I insist."

**What this means:**
- Jemini is off-screen during Port Gelling business, but her timer is still ticking
- Cassie sends updates to the party: *"She's getting worse. The fever won't break. Please - you have to find help."*
- The party can visit, but Nana's Sweetiebots are always nearby
- If the party wants to take Jemini somewhere (like the cave), they need Nana's permission - or they need to sneak her out
- Nana is watching Jemini's symptoms closely. She's seen the miners who "went strange." She knows something is wrong.

**If the party objects:**
> "You're welcome to take her, of course. But where would you go? Doctor Bobo? He's good for broken bones and infections. This..." *She gestures vaguely.* "This is something else, isn't it?"
>
> *A pause.*
>
> "I have resources. Contacts. If there's something that can help her, I can find it faster than you can. Leave her with me. Focus on finding answers."

---

**1. Nana Wants a Debrief**

Nana Sweetie didn't send that shuttle for free. She wants to know what happened at the compound - for her records, her security, and her curiosity.

> A Greeter Sweetiebot intercepts them within an hour of landing. Its smile is cheerful. Its message is not optional.
>
> "Nana Sweetie requests your presence at your earliest convenience! Which is now. She has questions about the Servants of the Unseen Horizon and their recent... dissolution."

---

### NANA SWEETIE - Full NPC Profile

**Species:** Human
**Age:** At least 100, possibly much older
**Role:** Governor / crime lord / owner of Port Gelling - all in one

**Appearance:**
> An extremely elderly Black woman with her white hair in a loose, grandmotherly bun. She's seated in a futuristic wheelchair with a blanket on her lap, having a cup of tea. More wrinkles than skin. She gives the impression of a doddering old woman just happy to have someone stop by and chat.

**The Truth:**
This impression could not be further from the truth. Every innocuous question is a test. Every glance and movement noticed. She is an elderly Machiavelli - sees everything, gives away nothing. The kindly grandmother act is a face she puts on when it's useful. And it's useful *a lot*.

**Nana doesn't slip.** When Ringo caught that small expression of satisfaction during their first meeting, she *let* him see it. It was intentional - a tipping of the hand. A message: *"I see you. You're worth working with. And I want you to know I know."*

**Voice & Mannerisms:**
- Speaks slowly, warmly, like she has all the time in the world
- Offers tea. Always offers tea. Watching how you take it tells her something.
- Uses endearments: "dear," "sweetheart," "child" - but they're not affection, they're positioning
- Asks questions that sound like small talk but aren't: *"And how did you find the compound? Any trouble on the way?"*
- Never raises her voice. Never needs to.
- When she's pleased, a small smile. When she's displeased, the same small smile.
- Everything she shows you, she *chose* to show you.

**What She Knows:**
- She arrived with the very first wave - some say she was HERE when the Drift Beacon activated, though how that's possible nobody knows.
- She built Port Gelling from nothing in under five years. That kind of speed requires resources and connections nobody asks about.
- She knows the ruins are dangerous. She doesn't know the details, but she's survived by knowing when not to ask questions.
- She suspects Bori was into something worse than drugs. She wants to know what.

**The Sweetiebot Hierarchy:**

| Model | Function | Threat Level |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Greeter | Summons, directions, hospitality | None (but always watching) |
| Helper | Assistants, service, retail | None |
| Patrol | Police force, peacekeeping | Low (but numerous) |
| Protector | Compound guards, escort | Moderate |
| **M.A.D.S.** | Nana's personal guard | *Extreme* |

**M.A.D.S.** - Her elite unit. Significantly more intelligent than standard Sweetiebots. Can hold actual conversations. Makes joking threats that aren't jokes. The party met M.A.D.S. at her office door on their first visit.

**Previous Interactions:**
- First meeting: Party escorted through compound, met M.A.D.S., had tea with Nana
- Posie helped make tea → received "I'm a Sweetie Too!" pin (secretly a tracking device)
- Ringo impressed her with strategic acumen - read between the lines of what she *really* wanted
- She let him see her satisfaction. He's marked as someone worth cultivating.

### Sample Dialogue

**Opening:**
> "There you are, dears. Come in, come in. Tea? I just put the kettle on."
>
> *She's lying. The tea has been ready for exactly as long as it took you to arrive.*

**On the cult compound:**
> "I heard there was quite a commotion. Explosions. Screaming. The sort of thing that makes the neighbors nervous."
>
> *She pauses to sip her tea.*
>
> "Tell me everything. Leave nothing out. I do so enjoy a good story."

**Probing for the source:**
> "Enhanced niaqui. My competitors have been whispering about it for months. Better high, longer duration, more... *transformative*, they say."
>
> *Her eyes, rheumy and ancient, are suddenly very sharp.*
>
> "If Bori cracked that formula... where was he getting his supply? What was the source?"

**If they're evasive:**
> "You're holding something back."
>
> *She smiles. The same warm, grandmotherly smile.*
>
> "That's fine, dear. Everyone does. I'm sure you have your reasons."
>
> *She doesn't press. She doesn't need to. She'll find out eventually.*

**On the goblins (before Ringo speaks up):**
> "I'll be sending a crew to secure the compound. Salvage what's useful, lock down what isn't. But first I'll need to clear out that band of space goblin hoodlums squatting near the entrance."
>
> *She waves a hand dismissively.*
>
> "Vermin."

**If Ringo vouches for Guk:**
> *She looks at Ringo for a long moment. The grandmother mask slips - no, she lets it slip. What's underneath is appraising. Calculating.*
>
> "You're vouching for them. Personally."
>
> *A beat.*
>
> "Fine. YOUR goblins. Your responsibility. If they cause me problems, I'm billing you. With interest."

**If nobody vouches (or they stay silent):**

Nana's crew "clears" the goblins within 24 hours. The party doesn't see it happen - they just hear about it later.

> "Oh, that goblin infestation? Handled. My boys are thorough."
>
> *She sips her tea.*
>
> "Vermin breed fast. Best to deal with them before they become a real problem."

**Immediate Consequences:**
- If anyone asks: 12 goblins dead. Guk among them. Quick, efficient, professional.
- Nana doesn't apologize. She doesn't explain. This is just how Port Gelling stays tidy.
- If the party expresses disapproval: *"They were squatting on MY salvage operation, dear. What did you expect?"*

**Future Consequences:**
- Other goblins in the system hear about it. Word spreads: Port Gelling is a death trap.
- If the party ever needs goblin help later, the reception is cold. *"Port Gelling people? You work with the grandmother-machine. We don't help her friends."*
- Optional hook: A survivor (one of Guk's crew who wasn't there) tracks the party down. Revenge? Plea for help? Information about what the goblins saw at the compound that Nana didn't want getting out?

**For Nana (Long-term):**
- She made an efficient, practical decision. It was also callous and brutal.
- If the party becomes important enough to matter, this becomes a data point about who Nana really is.
- If they ever turn on her, this is ammunition: *"You let her murder twelve people because they were inconvenient. You were right there."*

---

### GUK FOLLOW-UP SCENE (If Ringo Vouched)

**Context:** Guk is the leader of the space goblin band that was squatting near the cult compound. They're opportunists, not evil - they just wanted to pick over the scraps. If Ringo vouched for them with Nana, this scene follows up on that.

**Timing:** After the Nana debrief, sometime during Port Gelling business. Guk finds Ringo.

---

**The Approach:**

> You spot them before they spot you. A cluster of space goblins trying very hard to look casual near the water reclamation station. They're failing. Goblins aren't built for casual.
>
> When Guk sees you, something shifts in his posture. Not fear - respect. Maybe the first time a goblin has looked at you that way.
>
> He approaches alone. The others hang back, watching.
>
> "Cat-man. We need to talk."

**Guk's Offer:**

> "You spoke for us. To the scary grandmother-machine lady. Nobody speaks for goblins. We speak for ourselves or we get spoken AT."
>
> *He's clearly rehearsed this. His Common is rough but deliberate - deep voice, vague Brooklyn accent.*
>
> "This makes a debt. Goblins pay debts. Not because we're GOOD -" *he spits* "- but because debts unpaid become chains. And goblins don't wear chains."
>
> "So. What you need from Guk's crew?"

**What Guk Can Offer:**

| Service | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Information** | Goblins see things. They've been watching the compound for weeks. They know the patrol routes, the supply drops, who came and went. |
| **Scavenging** | Need something found in the ruins? They'll look. They're small, they're careful, and they don't ask questions. |
| **Distraction** | Need something loud and chaotic happening somewhere else? Goblins are VERY good at that. |
| **Message running** | They move around Port Gelling without being noticed. Information can travel. |
| **Muscle** | They're not fighters, but there's a lot of them. Warm bodies for a cause, if the pay is right. |

**What Guk Wants (Eventually):**

If Ringo takes him up on the offer and treats the goblins fairly:

> "You're different, cat-man. Most big-people see goblins as vermin. Rats with tools. You see us as... what? Workers? Allies?"
>
> *He squints at him.*
>
> "We been moving. Always moving. System to system. No home. Just the next place to not die."
>
> "Maybe... maybe we stop moving. If there's a place. If someone with voice speaks and says 'these goblins stay.'"
>
> *He doesn't ask directly. Goblins never ask directly. But the question is there.*

**If Ringo offers them a place:**
- The goblins become recurring allies
- They set up in the margins of Port Gelling (maintenance tunnels, unused cargo bays)
- Nana knows. She allows it because Ringo vouched. But she's watching.
- They're loyal to RINGO specifically, not the party
- Future hook: Someone tries to drive them out. Ringo has to decide how much he'll risk for "his" goblins.

**If Ringo keeps it transactional:**
- The goblins honor the debt, then move on
- No hard feelings - this is how most people treat them
- They might show up again, but as free agents, not allies

**Guk's Personality:**

- **Voice:** Deep, gravelly, vague Brooklyn accent. Sounds like he's done a lot of deals in back alleys.
- Pragmatic to the bone
- Values survival above everything, but has a code
- Doesn't trust easily, but trusts actions over words
- Uses "we" and "goblins" more than "I" - collective identity
- Secretly dreams of a place goblins don't have to hide
- Will die for his crew without hesitation

**Sample Dialogue:**

On the cult compound:
> "We watched the flesh-cult for weeks. Saw the changes. Saw people go in human, come out... not."
>
> *He shrugs.*
>
> "Not our business. Goblins learn: don't touch what you don't understand. Just wait for the scraps."

On Nana:
> "The grandmother-machine scares us. Not the bots - the WOMAN. You look in her eyes, you see someone who has killed more people than we've ever met."
>
> "And she smiles the whole time."

On Ringo:
> "You have 'ran from something' in your walk. Goblins know that walk. We ALL walk that way."
>
> *A flash of teeth - goblin grin.*
>
> "Maybe we understand each other, cat-man."

---

**The warning (if she likes them):**
> "The deep ruins are older than anyone remembers. Older than the Drift Beacon. Older than me, even."
>
> *A dry chuckle. She lets them wonder if that's a joke. Given the rumors about when she arrived, maybe it isn't.*
>
> "This system was sealed off for a reason. The Beacon opening changed things. People who dig too deep tend to find things. And the things... tend to find them back."
>
> *She sips her tea.*
>
> "Just something to keep in mind, dears."

---

**What Nana wants to know:**
- What was Bori actually doing? (She suspected drugs. Reality is worse.)
- Is the operation shut down or just disrupted?
- Are there loose ends that might cause her problems?

**What Nana is ESPECIALLY interested in:**
The enhanced niaqui source. If the party confirms it exists AND reveals where it comes from, she files that away.

**CAMPAIGN TIMER:** If the party reveals the SOURCE of the enhanced niaqui (the Precursor ruins, the Newborn flesh, any of it), Nana files that information away. She's a businesswoman. She'll investigate.

- **Immediate:** Nothing visible. Nana thanks them for the intel.
- **Weeks later:** Nana sends her own people to the ruins.
- **Months later:** Enhanced niaqui begins appearing in Port Gelling's drug supply.
- **Long-term:** The drug spreads. People start changing. The Newborn's influence grows through commerce instead of cult.

The party doesn't know they're starting this timer. They just answered Nana's questions. Consequences come later.

**If they lie or stay vague:**
- Nana's suspicious but accepts it.
- Timer doesn't start. She investigates on her own, slower, may never find the source.

**What Nana might offer:**
- Payment bonus if the intel is good
- Future work: *"I may have other problems that need your particular skills."*
- The warning about the ruins (see dialogue above)

**Seed for later:** How is Nana still alive at 100+? Some say she was already HERE when the Drift Beacon activated - which should be impossible. How did she get here before Drift travel was possible? That's a mystery for another day.

**IMPORTANT - Verification & Consequences:**
Nana WILL verify what the party tells her. Her people will sweep the compound. Guk's goblins will talk (for the right price or pressure). Anything she discovers they held back or - worse - lied about will be held against them.

- **Omissions she discovers:** Trust damaged. Future jobs come with less up-front pay, more oversight. *"I'm sure it just slipped your mind, dear."*
- **Outright lies she catches:** Relationship potentially hostile. She doesn't confront - she just stops calling. And her doors quietly close to them around Port Gelling.
- **Full honesty (even bad news):** Trust builds. She respects people who give her complete intel, even when it's ugly. Future opportunities open up.

The more they share, the more she trusts them going forward. Nana rewards reliability over likability.

**2. Loot Identification**

The party has items from Bori's stash. Some need identification or appraisal.

| Item | Who Can Help | Time |
|------|--------------|------|
| Commercial Nano-edge Rapier | Katar (Kill) or Pawnshop | Quick - standard item |
| Dizzying Anesthetic (poison) | "Doctor" Fowl or Doctor Bobo | 15 min - uncommon |
| Shrink Spell Amp | Asimov or Oddz'n'Endz | 20 min - magical item |
| Specimen Jar (flesh sample) | ??? | Nobody wants to touch this |

**The Specimen Jar problem:**
If they try to get the preserved communion flesh identified:
- Doctor Bobo: *"I don't... I don't want to open that. I can see it moving. It's in a sealed jar and I can see it MOVING."*
- Asimov: *"This is biological. Far outside my expertise. And frankly, my comfort zone."*
- Cog: *"Fascinating. Horrifying. But fascinating. I'd need proper lab equipment to analyze it. And I'm not sure I want to."*

The jar is a mystery they carry with them. Nobody in Port Gelling can help. Maybe the Midwife can explain it later.

---

**3. Cult Survivor**

Not everyone in the Servants of the Unseen Horizon was at the compound. Some were in town. Running errands. Recruiting. Living double lives.

One of them finds the party.

> A young human woman approaches. Nervous. Keeps looking over her shoulder.
>
> "You're the ones who... who stopped Bori. I saw you leave with Jemini."
>
> She's shaking.
>
> "I want out. I never... he said we'd transcend. Become something greater. But I saw what happened to Vell. She started changing and she was so *happy* about it and then she wasn't Vell anymore."
>
> "Please. Is there somewhere safe? Someone who can help me disappear?"

**Her name:** Mira. Low-level cultist. Believed the pitch, got cold feet when the transformations started.

**What she knows:**
- The "initiation prep" involved something being put inside you. She refused at the last minute.
- Bori talked about "the source" in the caves. Guards went there regularly.
- There are maybe 3-4 other cultists still in Port Gelling. Scared. Hiding. Waiting to see what happens.

**What she wants:**
- Safe passage off-world, or
- Assurance the remaining cultists won't come after her, or
- Just someone to tell her she's not damned for what she almost became

**Resolution options:**
- Point her to Chk Chk (discrete, won't ask questions)
- Take her to Cassie (who might have feelings about cult members)
- Tell her to figure it out herself (cold but valid)

This takes time. Meanwhile, at Nana's compound, Jemini's condition worsens. Cassie sends a message: *"The fever's worse. She's talking to herself. Please hurry."*

---

### THE OTHER CULTIST SURVIVORS

Mira mentions 3-4 others hiding in Port Gelling. Here they are if the party goes looking - or if you need them to show up.

---

**DAVROS** - The True Believer

*Shirren male, middle-aged. Ship mechanic.*

**Where:** Hiding in the maintenance tunnels under the docking bay. Living off stolen rations.

**Personality:** Unlike Mira, Davros still believes. He thinks Bori's death was a TEST - that the faithful will be rewarded for enduring.

> "You don't understand. The Newborn doesn't abandon its children. Bori was the prophet, but the message is still true. We just have to... to wait. To be ready."
>
> *His compound eyes are unsettling. Something behind them that wasn't there before.*
>
> "The seeds are still inside me. I can feel them. Growing. Becoming."

**The catch:** Davros had his initiation. The Seeds are in him. Unlike Jemini, he WANTS to change.

**Options:**
- Convince him to seek the cure (very difficult - Diplomacy DC 24)
- Forcibly take him to the Midwife (requires capture, moral complexity)
- Leave him to his fate (he'll transform eventually - becomes The Incomplete later)
- Kill him (mercy? murder? the party decides)

**What he knows:**
- Bori had a second journal, hidden somewhere in the compound (true - it's in the collapsed section)
- There's a "Mother" out there somewhere, bigger than anything on Antares Prime
- *"Bori spoke to it once. The Mother. He said it was sleeping, but dreaming of us."*

---

**KELLIX** - The Recruiter

*Ysoki female, young adult. Former con artist.*

**Where:** Operating openly - she's charming enough that nobody suspects her of cult connections. Currently working at Todd's bar.

**Personality:** Kellix joined for the perks, not the faith. Free housing, community, a sense of purpose. She was never a true believer - she was working an angle. Now that angle got her friends killed.

> "Look, I didn't sign up to become a tentacle monster, okay? I joined because the food was free and nobody asked questions about my past. I smiled, I said the prayers, I kept my head down."
>
> *She's nervous. Keeps checking the door.*
>
> "The second things got weird - like, REALLY weird - I got out. But Bori had files on all of us. Leverage. If Nana finds those files..."

**The catch:** Kellix knows where Bori kept his blackmail material. She wants to destroy it before anyone else finds it.

**Options:**
- Help her retrieve/destroy the files (small dungeon crawl in the compound ruins)
- Use the information yourself (leverage over multiple people)
- Turn her over to Nana (Nana would find her useful - and expendable)

**What she knows:**
- Names of cult members in other settlements (not just Port Gelling)
- The cult's supply lines - how they moved materials and people
- Bori was getting funding from *somewhere* off-world - she never found out where

---

**VENN** - The Witness

*Human male, elderly. Former cult "historian."*

**Where:** Sitting in plain sight at the pawnshop, pretending to browse. Too old and broken to run.

**Personality:** Venn was Bori's archivist. He documented everything - the rituals, the transformations, the "successes." He's seen things that shattered him. Now he just wants to confess.

> "I wrote it all down. Every communion. Every change. Bori wanted a record - proof that it worked."
>
> *His hands shake.*
>
> "I watched them change. I *catalogued* them. I gave each transformation a number. A description. Like they were specimens."
>
> "Seventy-three. I documented seventy-three people becoming... becoming something else. And I never once tried to stop it."

**The catch:** Venn's journals are a treasure trove of information about the Newborn, the rituals, and the transformation process. They're also evidence of horrific crimes.

**Options:**
- Take his journals (invaluable research - and deeply disturbing reading)
- Help him turn himself in (to whom? Nana's not exactly law enforcement)
- Offer him redemption (work to undo what he enabled)

**What he knows:**
- Detailed information about how the Seeds work (could help the Midwife cure others)
- The transformation has STAGES - and some people made it through successfully
- There are "completed" cultists out there - fully transformed, fully sapient, living among normal people
- *"They look human. Mostly. But they're not. They're... networked. Connected. To each other. To the Newborn."*

---

**Optional: COMPLETED CULTIST**

If you want to raise the stakes, one of the "survivors" is actually a SUCCESSFUL transformation. They look perfectly normal. They're watching the party.

**Name:** Zara (human female, 30s, works at the general store)

**The truth:** She completed her communion months ago. She's a vector - not a leader, not even aware of her role, but something in her responds to the Newborn's will. She reports what she sees without knowing she's reporting.

**Signs (if anyone is looking):**
- Perception DC 22: Her eyes don't quite track correctly - like there's a lag
- Medicine DC 20 (touch): Pulse is wrong. Double-rhythm.
- Posie's friends: They FLEE from her. *"Not-person. Shell with something inside."*

**GM Notes:**
This is a hook, not a mandatory encounter. If the party is paranoid, reward that paranoia. If not, Zara watches them leave and the information goes... somewhere.

---

### USING THE SURVIVORS

**If the party doesn't look for them:**
- Mira finds them (as written)
- Maybe one more shows up (Kellix at the bar, or Venn at the pawnshop)
- The others are background - possible future complications

**If the party actively hunts:**
- Let them find all four
- Each one is a moral puzzle with no clean answer
- Davros in particular is a ticking time bomb

**The broader point:**
The cult didn't exist in a vacuum. These people have lives, fears, regrets. Some deserve sympathy. Some deserve justice. Figuring out which is which is the party's problem.

---

---

**4. Ship Status (If Applicable)**

If the party has a ship or ongoing vehicle concerns:

> B3rt0 chirps an alert. The shuttle's port thruster is running hot. Nothing critical, but it needs attention before any long-haul travel.
>
> Estimated repair time: 2-3 hours. Cost: Minimal if they do it themselves, 50 credits if they pay someone.

This is purely mechanical downtime, but it grounds the session in practicality and gives an excuse for them to be stuck in Port Gelling while things develop.

---

### Jemini Deteriorating (Beats to Drop)

Jemini is Stage 1 when they arrive. Over the session, she progresses toward Stage 2. Drop these beats throughout Port Gelling scenes:

**Early (Stage 1 - Subtle):**
- She's quiet. Withdrawn. Normal for someone whose world just collapsed.
- Picks at her food. Says she's not hungry.
- If anyone's watching: she scratches her forearms absently. Doesn't seem to notice she's doing it.

**Middle (Stage 1 → 2 Transition):**
- Fever. She's warm to the touch. *"I'm fine. Just tired."*
- Veins on her arms look darker. Could be lighting. Could be imagination.
- She's muttering. Caught mid-sentence: *"...almost complete..."* then snaps out of it. *"What? I didn't say anything."*
- Stares at nothing. When asked what she's looking at: *"The pattern. Don't you see it?"* There's nothing there.

**If Prismara is having sensory disturbances at the same moment:**
> Jemini's head turns toward Prismara. Slowly. Too slowly.
>
> "You see it too, don't you? The way everything connects?"
>
> *She smiles. It doesn't reach her eyes.*
>
> "The blind one sees more than any of you."

This should deeply unsettle Prismara - and the party. How does Jemini know what Prismara is experiencing?

**Late (Stage 2 - Visible):**
- The veins are definitely darker. Visible through her skin like dark rivers.
- She flinches from bright light.
- If touched, her pulse is wrong. Too fast. Or maybe there's a second rhythm underneath.
- *"He said I'd feel strange until I was complete. I think... I think I'm almost there."* She sounds *happy* about it.

**If they take her to Doctor Bobo:**

> Doctor Bobo's six hands move with unusual stillness as she examines Jemini. Her usual manic energy is gone.
>
> "This isn't... this isn't sickness. This isn't bacteria or virus or toxin. There's something *in* her. Growing. I can see it moving under her skin."
>
> She looks at the party. For once, she's not smiling.
>
> "I don't know how to help her. This isn't medicine. This is something else."

---

### Hooks to the Cave

**Primary: Bori's Journal (From Prologue)**
The coordinates in the journal's spine. One points to the compound (crossed out), one to Haunted Sif, one encrypted. But there are references to *"the source"* and *"the vessel that tends the garden."*

> *"She resists, but her function overrides her will. The Midwife cannot refuse to nurture. It is her nature. I have bent that nature to our purpose."*

If they connect the dots: Bori had someone captive who could help. She's still there.

**Color: Posie's Friends React (Opposition, Not Guidance)**
When near Jemini, Posie's friends act strange - but not helpful:

> They won't go near her. Every time Posie gets close to Jemini, the friends retreat to the far side of her body, clustering away from the lashunta like she's radioactive.
>
> "Friends don't like her. Say she has... wrongness. Growing wrongness. They're scared."

This reinforces that something is deeply wrong with Jemini. The friends sense the Newborn's influence and want nothing to do with it - Precursor nanites vs. Newborn forces are opposed. They can confirm she's infected but won't point toward a cure.

**Backup (DM Hand-Hold): Jemini Herself**
If they're stuck, in a lucid moment:

> "He talked about it. The source. Something in the caves that gave him the gift. He said it didn't want to help him but it couldn't refuse. Its nature wouldn't let it."
>
> "He laughed about that. Trapping something and making it serve him."
>
> "I don't want to die. I don't want to become... please. *Please* help me."

---

### Alternate Paths (If They Don't Pursue the Cave)

**Leave Jemini to Her Fate**
- Cassie's reaction: Devastating. *"I hired you to save her. You brought her back and you're going to let her become... that?"*
- Jemini progresses to Stage 3 by session end. Stage 4 by next session. Becomes a recurring problem/tragedy.
- Dark but valid character choice. Consequences should be real.

**Find Another Cure**
- Doctor Bobo: Can slow progression but not stop it. Buys time (24 hours per treatment).
- Oddz'n'Endz: *"We've got weird stuff, but nothing that weird. Sorry."*
- The Pawnshop Trio: Jim frowns. *"I've seen a lot come through here. Never seen anything that cures... whatever that is."*
- Dead ends that point back to the cave.

**Pursue Other Coordinates**
- Haunted Sif: Posie's pull destination. Major journey, not a quick trip. Could be next arc.
- Encrypted coordinates: Computers DC 18 reveals deep space location marked "THE MOTHER." Way beyond current scope.
- Validates the larger conspiracy exists but doesn't solve immediate problem.

**Deal with Port Gelling Business**
- Shopping, selling loot, downtime
- Can fill time but Jemini's clock is ticking
- Every scene in town, remind them she's getting worse

---

### Port Gelling NPC Moments (Optional Color)

Drop these in during downtime or shopping:

**Herman's Pitch**
> A large bald man with an impressive waxed mustache blocks their path, four squoxes draped across his shoulders.
>
> "Friends! You look like people who need companionship! Eight-legged, furry companionship! This one—" *lifts a squox* "—really likes you. I can tell."
>
> The squox looks deeply indifferent.

**Fr3d Patrol**
> An Observer-Class Security Robot walks past, humming tunelessly. It pauses, optical sensors fixed on the party for slightly too long.
>
> It nods—a distinctly non-standard robot behavior—and continues on.
>
> A passing merchant waves. "Hey Fr3d!"
>
> The robot doesn't respond. It never does.

**Todd's Observation**
If they drink at Gelling Bar and Grill:

> Todd pours without asking what they want. Somehow it's exactly right.
>
> He glances toward where Jemini sits, staring at nothing.
>
> "Seen that look before." He wipes a glass. "Knew a guy who worked the deep ruins. Came back different. Kept talking about patterns. Said he could see how everything connected."
>
> "He went back. Didn't come out."
>
> Todd shrugs. Not his problem. But he said it anyway.

**Jim at the Pawnshop**
If they bring loot to appraise or sell:

> While Krull argues loudly about fair pricing and Shuuthul counters with depreciation statistics, Jim quietly examines their finds.
>
> "This is good stuff. Where'd you get it?" He doesn't press. Just curious.
>
> He notices them glancing back toward the door. Toward Jemini.
>
> "You folks look like you're carrying something heavy. Not the gear. Something else."
>
> He doesn't offer advice. Just acknowledgment. Sometimes that's enough.

---

## Precursor Ruins - Cave

### Scene Purpose

The cave is the SOURCE of the Newborn flesh Bori cultivated. An eggshell fragment from the Newborn's passage. But when the party arrives, they don't find guards - they find a **war**.

Two incomprehensible forces are locked in slow, grinding combat. Neither cares about the party except as obstacles. The Midwife is trapped in the crossfire.

---

### What the Party Walks Into

> The tunnel opens into a vast cavern, and you hear it before you see it - wet tearing sounds, the crunch of chitin, a keening that might be screaming or might be something else entirely.
>
> Two... things... are locked together near the far wall. One is humanoid, or was - flesh rippling, bones visible through translucent skin, face frozen mid-shift between expressions. The other is insectoid, the size of a dog, mandibles locked around the humanoid's arm while it tries to drag the thing backward.
>
> More movement. Another humanoid shape crawling toward a faintly glowing formation in the cave's center, leaving a trail of something wet. Two more insect-things converging on it.
>
> And in the corner, huddled against the wall, something else entirely. Watching. Waiting.

The Midwife. She's been here for days, unable to leave, watching this play out.

---

### The Factions

#### THE INCOMPLETE (Former Cultists)

**What happened:** When Bori died mid-apotheosis, the transformation energy he was channeling didn't vanish - it backlashed through anyone connected to his ritual network. The Seeds he'd planted in his most devoted followers *activated*. But without Bori to guide the change, they became something wrong. Incomplete. Still changing, unable to stop.

**What they want:** To reach the fragment. Proximity is the only thing that soothes the agony of unfinished transformation. They'll go *through* anyone between them and relief.

**What they look like:**

> Humanoid, but wrong. Skin too thin - you can see things moving underneath. Bones that don't match from one side to the other. Faces that shift between expressions without transitioning, like a broken display cycling through images.
>
> One of them is crying. The tears are the wrong color.

**Obfuscation:** They look like Newborn corruption made manifest. The party will likely assume this is what all cultists become, or what Jemini will become. They won't know this only happened because Bori's ritual was interrupted - that these are *botched* transformations, not successful ones.

**Behavior:**
- Ignore the party unless blocked from the fragment
- Will attack anyone between them and the glowing formation
- Don't communicate except for occasional fragments: *"...almost... please... let me be complete..."*
- If allowed to reach the fragment, they collapse against it and go still (not dead, but finally at peace)

---

#### THE HOLLOW (Ancient Defense System)

**GM Name:** The Hollow (Precursor biotech defense constructs)
**Player Name:** "The skittering things" / "those bug-things" / whatever they naturally call them
**Midwife's Name:** *"The Hollow. The clean ones. They wish to make everything... tidy."*

**What they are:** Biotech constructs that have been dormant for millennia. Bori's meddling woke them. Their purpose: contain contamination, purge foreign biology.

**What they want:** Eliminate all biological contamination in the cave system. This includes the Incomplete, the party, and the Midwife. The fragment itself is what they're *protecting*.

**What they look like:**

> Insects. That's the first impression - chitinous bodies, compound eyes, mandibles. The size of large dogs, skittering across stone with unsettling coordination.
>
> But something's off. Too symmetrical. Too precise. And when one of them dies, it doesn't bleed - it *vents*, like a punctured pressure seal.

**Obfuscation:** They look like cave creatures or possibly Newborn spawn. Only on very close inspection might someone notice:
- Perception DC 20: The "chitin" has visible seams, like armor plating
- Nature DC 22: These don't match any known species - the biology is *wrong*
- Tu'Sev Akashic check: A flash of recognition, immediately slipping away. These are old. Older than the Gap. He can't hold onto the knowledge.

**Do NOT volunteer that these are Precursor technology.** Let the party draw their own conclusions. If they assume "weird cave bugs," that's fine. If they ask the Midwife, she calls them "The Hollow" but doesn't explain what that means.

**Behavior:**
- Attack anything biological that moves
- Prioritize the Incomplete (highest contamination signature)
- Will attack party members who get too close to the fragment
- Coordinate without audible communication
- If reduced to one remaining, it retreats into the walls (they can phase through stone)

---

### Encounter Mechanics

**Budget:** Severe (120 XP for 4 Level 3 PCs)

**Starting situation:** The factions are already fighting when the party arrives. This is NOT a fresh combat - it's been going on for hours or days.

#### The Combatants

| Creature | Level | XP | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| The Incomplete | 2 | 20 | 3 | Former cultists, tragic |
| Hollow Drone | 1 | 15 | 3 | Skittering things |
| Hollow Prime | 3 | 40 | 1 | Larger skittering thing |

**Total if party fights everything:** 145 XP (Severe+)
**But they shouldn't have to.**

---

### The Tactical Situation

**The party has options:**

1. **Fight through both sides** - Hardest path. 145 XP of hostiles.

2. **Let them weaken each other** - Wait, then mop up survivors. Risk: Midwife might get caught in crossfire. The Incomplete might reach the fragment (ending their threat but blocking access).

3. **Side with the Hollow** - Help eliminate the Incomplete. The skittering things will then turn on the party, but weakened.

4. **Side with the Incomplete** - Help them reach the fragment. They go dormant. The skittering things now focus entirely on party. (Why would the party do this? Mercy. The Incomplete are clearly suffering.)

5. **Sneak to the Midwife** - Stealth around the edges while they fight. Grab her, get out. Risky but possible.

6. **The Midwife's help** - If they reach her, she can do something. See below.

---

### The Midwife's Role

She's been watching this for days. She understands both sides better than the party ever will.

**If the party reaches her:**

> "You came for the girl. Yes. I can help her. But first we must leave, and leaving is... complicated."
>
> She gestures at the battle.
>
> "The changed ones seek completion. The others seek purity. Neither will permit us to pass."

**What she can do:**

- **Calm an Incomplete (2 actions):** Touch + Will save. On failure, the Incomplete goes dormant for 1 minute. *"I am a Midwife. I can soothe, even if I cannot finish what was started."*

- **Distract the Hollow (2 actions):** She exudes something - a chemical, a signal. All of the skittering things must spend their next turn moving toward her instead of attacking. *"They want to purge me most of all. I am the greatest contamination here."* (This hurts her - she takes 2d6 damage each time)

- **Reveal weakness (free):** *"The crawling ones reform if left alone. You must damage them faster than they can repair. Or you must damage what coordinates them."* (Points at the larger one)

**She will NOT fight.** Violence is antithetical to her nature.

---

### Creature Stat Blocks

#### THE INCOMPLETE                                    CREATURE 2
NE Medium Aberration (formerly Humanoid)
**Perception** +6; darkvision, tremorsense 30 ft. (imprecise)
**Languages** understands Common but can only speak fragments
**Skills** Athletics +8, Stealth +5
**Str** +3, **Dex** +1, **Con** +4, **Int** -2, **Wis** +0, **Cha** -3

---
**AC** 16; **Fort** +10, **Ref** +5, **Will** +4
**HP** 38; **Immunities** poison, disease; **Weaknesses** cold iron 3
**Unfinished Regeneration** The Incomplete regains 3 HP at the start of its turn. If it takes cold iron damage, this regeneration doesn't function until the end of its next turn.

---
**Speed** 25 ft., climb 15 ft.
**Melee** [one-action] shifting limb +10 (reach 10 ft.), **Damage** 1d8+5 bludgeoning plus Grab
**Desperate Grasp** [one-action] **Requirements** The Incomplete has a creature grabbed; **Effect** The Incomplete pulls the grabbed creature 10 feet toward the fragment (or toward itself if not near the fragment). The creature can attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save to resist.
**Fragment Yearning** The Incomplete must end its turn closer to the fragment than it started, if possible. It takes a -2 penalty to attacks against creatures not blocking its path to the fragment.

**STORY NOTES:**
- These were people. Devoted cultists who trusted Bori.
- They're not evil - they're in agony.
- If one reaches the fragment, it collapses and goes still. Not dead, but no longer hostile.
- Killing them is mercy. Letting them reach the fragment is also mercy. Both are valid.

---

#### HOLLOW DRONE (Skittering Thing)                   CREATURE 1
N Small Construct (disguised as Beast)
**Perception** +8; darkvision, contamination sense 60 ft.
**Skills** Acrobatics +7, Athletics +5, Stealth +7
**Str** +1, **Dex** +3, **Con** +2, **Int** -4, **Wis** +2, **Cha** -5

---

**HP** 20; **Immunities** bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, mental, necromancy, nonlethal, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious
**Hardness** 3 (functions as resistance to all physical damage)

---
**Speed** 30 ft., climb 20 ft., burrow 10 ft. (stone only)
**Melee** [one-action] mandibles +9 (finesse), **Damage** 1d6+3 piercing
**Coordinated Tactics** Hollow Drones flank with each other and with the Hollow Prime automatically, even if not in flanking positions, as long as two or more are adjacent to the same target.
**Contamination Priority** The Hollow always target the nearest creature with the Aberration trait first. If no aberrations are present, they target the nearest biological creature.
**Phase Retreat** [two-actions] The Hollow Drone phases into solid stone and disappears. It can emerge from any stone surface within 30 feet at the start of its next turn.

**TRUE NATURE (GM ONLY):**
These are Precursor biotech - living machines designed to contain biological contamination. They predate the Gap by millennia. They're not evil, not good - just executing ancient programming.

Do NOT reveal this to players. Let them think "weird cave bugs."

---

#### HOLLOW PRIME (Larger Skittering Thing)            CREATURE 3
N Medium Construct (disguised as Beast)
**Perception** +11; darkvision, contamination sense 120 ft., tremorsense 30 ft.
**Skills** Acrobatics +9, Athletics +10, Stealth +9
**Str** +3, **Dex** +3, **Con** +3, **Int** -2, **Wis** +3, **Cha** -5

---
**AC** 19; **Fort** +10, **Ref** +11, **Will** +7
**HP** 50; **Immunities** bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, mental, necromancy, nonlethal, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious
**Hardness** 5
**Coordination Pulse** [reaction] **Trigger** A Hollow Drone within 30 feet misses with a Strike; **Effect** The Drone can immediately Stride 5 feet and Strike again with a -2 penalty.

---

**Melee** [one-action] reinforced mandibles +12, **Damage** 1d10+5 piercing
**Melee** [one-action] tail lash +12 (reach 10 ft., sweep), **Damage** 1d8+5 bludgeoning
**Purge Protocol** [two-actions] (area) The Custodian Prime vents a 15-foot cone of caustic vapor. Creatures in the area take 2d6 acid damage (DC 19 basic Reflex save). Aberrations take an additional 1d6 damage.
**Network Anchor** While the Hollow Prime is active, all Hollow Drones within 60 feet gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls and saving throws. If the Prime is destroyed, all Drones within 60 feet are stunned 1.

**TACTICAL NOTES:**
- The Prime coordinates the Drones. Kill it first to disrupt them.
- It hangs back and uses Purge Protocol to hit clusters.
- It will retreat into stone if reduced below 15 HP.

---

### Terrain Features

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **The Fragment** | Faintly glowing formation in cave center. 10 ft. diameter. Incomplete are drawn to it. Prismara's vision triggers on touch. |
| **Unstable Ground** | Patches of difficult terrain where the battle has torn up the floor |
| **Corpses** | 2-3 already-dead Incomplete and 1 destroyed skittering thing scattered around. Evidence the fight has been going on. |
| **The Midwife's Corner** | Slightly elevated alcove where the Midwife has taken shelter. Provides cover. |
| **Tunnels** | Multiple exits. The Hollow can phase through stone to emerge from any wall. |

---

### Resolution Paths

**Total victory (kill everything):** Possible but costly. 145 XP of enemies.

**Hollow victory (help them):** Incomplete are destroyed, the skittering things turn on party (weakened). ~60-80 XP remaining.

**Incomplete victory (help them):** Incomplete reach fragment and go dormant. The Hollow focus party. ~70-85 XP remaining.

**Stealth/rescue:** Party reaches Midwife without major engagement. She helps them escape. Minimal combat.

**Fragment reached:** If an Incomplete reaches the fragment, it collapses and stops fighting. Others may follow. This can end the threat from that side peacefully.

**Hollow Prime destroyed:** Drones are stunned, then disorganized. Fight becomes much easier.

---

### Clue Obfuscation Checklist

**DO NOT reveal:**
- The Hollow are Precursor technology
- The Incomplete are a *botched* transformation (let party assume this is normal)
- The fragment's true nature (just "glowing formation" unless they investigate)
- Any connection to Posie's friends (the Precursor nanite link)

**OKAY to reveal:**
- The skittering things are *weird* - something's off about them
- The Incomplete were cultists - one is still wearing a robe
- The Midwife knows more than she's saying
- The fragment soothes the Incomplete somehow

**Tu'Sev's Akashic connection:** If he tries to read the Hollow or the fragment, he gets static. A sense of *oldness*, of something predating the Record. Then it slips away. This should feel frustrating, not informative. The Akashic Record doesn't have data on this.

---

### Post-Combat

**If party investigates the fragment:**
- Perception DC 18: It's warm. Pulsing slightly. Almost like a heartbeat.
- Occultism DC 20: This isn't stone. It's... tissue? Fossilized tissue? No - still alive somehow.
- Touch: Triggers Prismara's vision (if she touches it). Others feel a moment of vertigo and wrongness.

**If party examines dead Hollow:**
- Medicine DC 20: No blood. No organs. The "chitin" is layered, almost mechanical.
- Crafting DC 22: The internal structure is too precise. Too regular. This was built.
- Don't explain further. Let them wonder.

**If party talks to surviving Incomplete:**
- They can barely communicate. Fragments of sentences.
- *"...Bori promised... said we'd be... beautiful... why does it hurt..."*
- If asked what happened: *"...he died... the Change stopped... we're stuck... please... let me finish..."*
- Killing them at this point feels like euthanasia, not combat.

## Vessel-of-Necessary-Change (The Midwife)

### What She Is

A Midwife of the Newborn from Aucturn. She *tends* to Change - nurtures transformation, ensures it proceeds correctly. Gardener, not general. Hospice worker for the old form, doula for the new.

An aberration with the **holy** trait. The Newborn is not evil - it is a cosmic principle. Its servants can be sacred.

### Appearance

> Something unfolds from the corner. Proportions wrong - limbs bending in too many places. Skin like translucent membrane over something luminous. Eyes not where you expect them.
>
> And yet there is something *gentle* in how she moves. Deliberate. Careful. Like a nurse around a sleeping patient.
>
> When she speaks, her voice sounds like it's coming from inside your own chest.

**Physical:** Translucent membrane-skin, faintly luminescent. Multiple joints. Eyes distributed across form. Tentacles that move with surprising delicacy. Smells like ozone, copper, and new growth.

### Voice & Mannerisms

- Speaks slowly, choosing words carefully
- Medical/biological metaphors
- "Becoming" and "completion" instead of transformation
- Never says "monster" or "corruption" - all Change is sacred
- Alien phrasing: "Your flesh is *restless*" instead of "You seem agitated"

### Sample Dialogue

**On her captivity:**
> "I do not *make* these seeds. That is not my function. I *tend*. What they did to me here was..."
>
> *A sound like cracking ice.*
>
> "Imagine being forced to perform surgery with a hammer. Again. And again."

**On the Newborn:**
> "The Newborn does not *want*. It simply *is*. A river does not want to reach the sea. A fire does not want to spread. These are merely... their natures."

**On Jemini:**
> "Your friend carries seeds planted without care. Without *intention*. They will bloom wrong. I can prune. Redirect. But only if she allows it."

**On Bori:**
> "He believed he was communing with a god. He was correct, in a sense. But he mistook *attention* for *affection*. The Newborn noticed him the way you might notice an insect walking across your hand. He asked to be changed. It obliged. It did not ask what he wished to *become*."
>
> *A pause. Something that might be pity.*
>
> "He was standing in front of an ocean and asking it to make him special."

### What She Wants

| Request | Offers |
|---------|--------|
| Freedom | Gratitude, answers, non-hostility |
| Cure Jemini | "A kindness I can provide" (requires Jemini's consent) |
| Leave fragment alone | Information about the Newborn, Precursors, larger picture |
| Let her tend it properly | Future ally, contact between worlds |

### What She Knows

**The Newborn:**
> "The 'eggshell' is not a remnant of birth - it is a remnant of *passage*. The Newborn moved through this place once. What remains is afterbirth. Potent. Sacred. Very dangerous to those who do not understand."

**The Precursors:**
> "The old ones who built these tunnels understood. They did not worship the Newborn, but they *respected* it. They built channels - ways for Change to flow without flooding. Your cult leader found the channels and tried to dam them. Redirect the flow into himself."
>
> *A sound like wind through hollow bones.*
>
> "Rivers do not like being dammed."

**The Seeds:**
> "A seed is not a weapon. A seed is a *possibility*. Planted with intention, tended with care, it becomes something beautiful. Planted carelessly..."
>
> *She gestures at the cave.*
>
> "You have seen what it becomes."

**Haunted Sif:**
> "The old ones built channels in many places. The world your small friend seeks... there are channels there too. Very old. Very powerful. Be careful what flows through them."

### Curing Jemini

**Requirements:**
- Jemini's **consent** (she may refuse - "It's all I have left of him")
- Proximity to the fragment (its energy helps stabilize the process)
- Time: approximately 10 minutes

**The Consent:**
> "I cannot force this. The seeds are part of her now - taking them without permission would be... surgery without anesthesia. On the soul."
>
> *The Midwife extends a tentacle toward Jemini, not touching.*
>
> "Child. I can remove what grows in you. But you must choose it. Truly choose."

**If Jemini refuses:**
> "It's all I have left of him. If you take it... I'm just... I'm nothing again."
>
> *She pulls away.*
>
> "He saw something in me. The Newborn saw something. If you take that away, what's left?"

**Persuading her (Diplomacy DC 18):**
- Success: She cries but nods. *"Fine. Do it. Before I change my mind."*
- Critical Success: A moment of clarity. *"I was so afraid of being ordinary. Maybe... maybe ordinary is okay."*
- Failure: *"Get AWAY from me."* She flees deeper into the cave. Chase or let her go.
- Critical Failure: She attacks. Desperation. *"You want to make me NOTHING again!"*

---

### THE CURE RITUAL

**Read-Aloud:**

> The Midwife positions herself behind Jemini, who kneels on the stone floor. The fragment's glow pulses—brighter, dimmer, brighter—like a slow heartbeat.
>
> "This will not be pleasant. I am sorry."
>
> Tentacles extend, touching points along Jemini's spine, her temples, the base of her skull. The contact is gentle. Almost tender.
>
> "Think of something true. Something from before. Hold onto it."

**Beat 1: The Search (Round 1-2)**

> Jemini's breath catches. Her eyes go wide—not in pain yet. In intrusion. Something is moving through her, LOOKING for what doesn't belong.
>
> Her hands claw at the stone floor.
>
> "I can feel it—feel YOU—moving through my—"
>
> The Midwife: "I know. I know. I am being as gentle as I can."

**Beat 2: The Finding (Round 3-4)**

> A gasp. Jemini arches backward.
>
> "There," the Midwife murmurs. "I have found them. They have grown... extensively."
>
> Jemini: "It feels like—like roots. All through me. I didn't know they were—how deep they—"
>
> The Midwife: "They were making a home of you. A vessel. Now I must evict them."

**Beat 3: The Drawing Out (Round 5-7)**

> Jemini SCREAMS.
>
> There is no hiding what this is: something is being *extracted* from her. Pulled out through her skin without breaking it. The veins that had darkened begin to writhe, moving toward points where the Midwife's tentacles touch.
>
> The Midwife's voice, steady despite the screaming: "Hold onto something true. Hold onto who you were."
>
> Between screams, Jemini gasps: "Mom—Mama used to—she sang to me—when I was—"
>
> She can't finish. Another scream.

**Beat 4: The Loss (Round 8-9)**

> The screaming stops. Something worse replaces it.
>
> Jemini is weeping. Not from pain—from grief.
>
> "I can feel it leaving. The... the connection. He said I was special. He said the Newborn SAW me. It's—it's going away. I'm going to be alone again."
>
> The Midwife: "You were always alone. What you felt was not connection—it was consumption. The seeds do not love their host."
>
> Jemini: "Then why does losing them hurt so much?"
>
> The Midwife has no answer for that.

**Beat 5: The Completion**

> The Midwife withdraws. Her tentacles are stained with something dark and iridescent—the seeds, drawn out, collected in her grasp.
>
> Jemini collapses, shaking, sobbing.
>
> The veins on her arms are fading. Normal color returning. But she doesn't look relieved.
>
> She looks *empty*.
>
> "It's done?"
>
> The Midwife: "It is done. You are... yourself again. Only yourself."
>
> *A pause.*
>
> "For some, that is enough."

---

### AFTERMATH

**Jemini's state:**
- Physically exhausted, needs rest (8 hours minimum)
- Emotionally devastated - she genuinely believed she was becoming something transcendent
- Doesn't thank them. Might not thank them for a long time.
- Possible line: *"You saved me. I know that. I just... I can't feel grateful yet. Maybe I never will."*

**The extracted seeds:**
The Midwife holds the Seeds of Flesh she removed. Dark, iridescent, still faintly pulsing.

> "These cannot be destroyed. Not truly. The Newborn's touch does not... un-touch."
>
> She considers.
>
> "I will take them with me. Return them to where they belong. Unless..."
>
> *She looks at the party.*
>
> "...you wish to keep them. For study. For safekeeping. For temptation."

**If they keep the seeds:**
- Powerful potential plot device/danger
- Midwife's warning: *"They will try to plant themselves. In you. In others. They do not understand containment. Be certain you do."*

**If they let her take them:**
- *"Wise. Painful things should be tended by those who understand pain."*
- She absorbs them into herself. They'll be returned to Aucturn eventually.

**Cassie's reunion (if Jemini is brought back cured):**

> Cassie doesn't run. She walks. Slowly. Like she's afraid Jemini might shatter.
>
> "Baby?"
>
> Jemini won't meet her eyes.
>
> "I'm not... I'm not who I was before, Mom. I don't know if I can be."
>
> Cassie pulls her into an embrace. Jemini resists for a moment. Then collapses into it.
>
> Neither speaks for a long time.

## Prismara's Sensory Disturbances (Building Throughout Session)

Prismara "sees" through echolocation - sound, vibration, texture, echo. As the session progresses toward the fragment, her senses start lying to her. Drop these in escalating order.

### Stage 1: Subtle (Bedroom Investigation)
*"Your clicks come back... wrong. For just a moment, the room felt bigger than it is. Like there was more space behind that wall than there should be."*

*"You taste copper in the air. Just for a second. Then it's gone."*

### Stage 2: Unsettling (Jemini Confrontation)
*"When Jemini speaks, you hear an echo that doesn't match her mouth. Like something else is speaking a half-second behind her, in a frequency just below hearing."*

*"Your echolocation paints the room normally - except there's a shape in the corner that wasn't there before. When you ping again, it's gone."*

### Stage 3: Wrong (Approaching the Cave)
*"The tunnel ahead should be empty. Your clicks say it is. But you FEEL something. Massive. Patient. Your echolocation insists nothing is there. Your fur says otherwise."*

*"For one terrible moment, every sound in the cave comes back as the same thing: a heartbeat. The walls. The dripping water. Your own footsteps. All one rhythm."*

### Stage 4: The Fragment (Just Before Discovery)
*"Your echolocation stops working. Not silence - VOID. Your clicks go out and don't come back. You are blind in a way you've never been blind before. And in that darkness, something is breathing."*

Then trigger the full vision when they find/touch the fragment.

## Prismara's Vision

### Setup: Bori's Research (found in bedroom)

Bori was studying Prismeni precognition. He wanted to replicate it through Newborn communion - sight across time, not just space. He was trying to become what she IS.

This makes her feel targeted. Even if he didn't know she was coming, she's exactly what he wanted to be.

### Trigger

At a climactic moment (GM discretion - perhaps touching the fragment, or during the Jemini cure, or in combat).

### The Vision

**Describe through SENSES, not sight. She's blind. Her visions are sensory impressions, not images.**

---

*It starts with drowning.*

*Not water. The viscosity is wrong. Heavier. She's in an ocean but something is OFF. It doesn't flow like water should. It clings. It pulls.*

*A wave engulfs her—*

---

*Flash. Heat against her fur. Metallic tang in the air. A place she doesn't recognize. Shouting in a language she almost understands.*

*Flash. Cold stone under her paws. Ancient. Something vast sleeping beneath her.*

*Flash. The hum of a ship's engine, but wrong - too many harmonics. Too alive.*

*Flash. Wind that tastes like copper. A world she's never been to.*

*Flash. Flash. Flash.*

*Planets. Places. Possibilities spinning off like sparks from a fire.*

---

*And then Posie.*

*She feels Posie charging at something. Determination like a bright thread. And then—*

*Posie SHATTERS.*

*Not dies. Splinters. A million fragments, each one a version of this moment, each one a different ending. Some triumphant. Some tragic. Some incomprehensible. Posie as a single point becoming infinite lines, spreading outward, each one a choice, a consequence, a—*

---

*It stops.*

*The chaos freezes. The fragments hang suspended.*

*And then it all... shifts.*

---

*She's floating. Weightless. The sensory noise is gone. There's only stillness.*

*And something in front of her.*

*She can't see it - she's never seen anything - but she FEELS it. Vast. Impossibly vast. A body that stretches beyond her ability to perceive, like trying to comprehend the size of a planet by touching a single grain of sand.*

*But the eye. She feels the eye.*

*Colossal. Ancient. And yet...*

*New.*

*Newly born.*

*The pupil moves. For the first time in its very brief existence, it focuses on something.*

*On her.*

---

*She snaps back.*

### Aftermath

- She's shaking, disoriented
- The vision is CONFUSING now - she doesn't understand what she saw
- Don't explain it. Let it sit.
- This pays off at the END of the campaign when they reach the climax

### Player Reaction

If Prismara's player asks what it meant:
- "You don't know. It felt like drowning in something that wasn't water. You saw - felt - places you've never been. Posie breaking into infinite pieces. And at the end... something saw you."
- "Something that had never looked at anything before."

## Quick Reference - Session Beats

1. **Bedroom** - Loot, Tu'Sev hooks, Prismara finds Bori's research on Prismeni
2. **Jemini** - Confrontation, notice the infection clues
3. **Cave** - Incomplete vs Hollow war, rescue Midwife (required for cure)
4. **Cure** - Midwife helps Jemini (if consented)
5. **Vision** - Triggered at climactic moment for Prismara

### Timing Estimate (~4 hours)
| Beat | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Bedroom | 30-45 min | Investigation, journals, Tu'Sev Akashic moment |
| Jemini | 30-60 min | Emotional RP, noticing infection |
| Cave | 60-90 min | Combat + Midwife rescue |
| Midwife/Cure | 30-45 min | Lore, negotiation, cure ritual |
| Vision | 10-15 min | Prismara's climactic moment |

**Flow:** Each beat leads to the next. Jemini's infection → need Midwife → cave is required. Only "optional" if they abandon her.

---

## Lore Notes (Background - don't dump on players)

### The Precursors
- Ancient biotech civilization
- Grey goo apocalypse - their nanites almost consumed everything
- Last-ditch solution: fragment the nanites into single-purpose "personalities"
- Scattered across Antares system: growth (Sauriels-Garden), travel/aid (Posie's friends), etc.
- The fragmentation halted the apocalypse but left the system seeded with dormant tech

### The Newborn
- Not evil, just Change incarnate
- Doesn't want anything - it simply IS
- Where its presence touches, transformation happens
- Bori mistook attention for affection
- The eggshell fragment is "afterbirth" from its passage through this place

### The Nanite Connection
- Posie's friends are Precursor nanites (travel/aid fragment)
- They received the Drift Signal and went looking for "help"
- The Mother Swarm on Haunted Sif is likely another fragment (coordination? communication?)
- If fragments reunite... they may regain adaptability. Grey goo 2.0?
- The Newborn's presence may be corrupting the original Precursor programming
