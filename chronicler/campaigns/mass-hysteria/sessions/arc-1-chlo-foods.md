# Arc 1 Recap - The Chlo Foods Asteroid

**Sessions:** 1-2 (Late 2025, pre-campaign formal dating)
**Location:** Port Gelling → Chlo Foods asteroid base

---

## Summary

The crew of the Mass Hysteria arrives in the Antares system, meets Nana Sweetie, and handles their first job: dealing with a malfunctioning asteroid base that's on a collision course with Antares Prime.

**Note:** This arc spanned multiple sessions. The campaign's first adventure - establishing the crew, their relationship with Nana, and unknowingly making their first corporate enemy.

## The Arrival

The crew of the Mass Hysteria (the ship name is a Ghostbusters reference - "cats and dogs, mass hysteria") hurtles through the Drift towards Antares Prime, the central hub of the newly Drift Beacon-connected Antares System. They have a connection with Nana Sweetie, local governor / crime lord / owner of Port Gelling.

**Port Gelling First Impressions:**
- Relatively bustling frontier city
- Full of rough-and-tumble types
- Peaceful due to the ever-present Sweetiebots
- Sweetiebots act as greeters, assistants, and police force
- Party hasn't seen them do anything but patrol and be friendly... yet

---

## Meeting Nana Sweetie

**The Escort:**
- Met a Greeting model Sweetiebot in a cantina
- Bot had a sign rotating through names until "Ringo" appeared
- Escorted via transport to Nana's Compound
- Protector model Sweetiebots led them through the compound
- Met M.A.D.S. at the office door - significantly more intelligent than standard bots, held actual conversation, made a joking threat

**Nana Herself:**
> An extremely elderly Black woman with her white hair in a loose, grandmotherly bun, seated in a futuristic wheelchair with a blanket on her lap, having a cup of tea. At LEAST 100 years old, more wrinkles than skin, gives the impression of a doddering old woman just happy to have someone stop by and chat.

**The Truth:**
This impression could not be further from the truth. Every innocuous question is a test. Every glance and movement noticed by this elderly Machiavelli - seeing everything, giving away nothing. The kindly grandmother act is a face she puts on when useful. And it's useful *a lot*.

**Party Interactions:**
- **Posie:** Took instant liking, helped make tea. Received "I'm a Sweetie Too!" pin (secretly a tracking device)
- **Ringo:** Impressed her with strategic acumen. Read between the lines - knew what she REALLY wanted done. Caught her small expression of satisfaction. She let him see it: a signal that this is a professional crew she could work with.

## The Job

**Mission:** "Send a message" to smugglers avoiding Nana's taxes. Additionally, their asteroid base has begun a crash course toward Antares Prime - find out why and stop it.

**Implied Reward:** They could "claim" the asteroid base as their own if they wanted.

## Ringo's Ship Log

> **Ship's Log: Entry 1**
> Recorded by: Ringo Stryx, Captain
> Date: 8/30/25
> Location(s): Antares Prime, Port Gelling, Unnamed asteroid smuggler base
>
> **NPCs:** Nana Sweetie - A sweet old lady who seems to run a large underworld operation based in Port Gelling. Since the system is newly settled, she is the closest known thing to a governing authority on Antares Prime.
>
> **Active Jobs/Goals:** "Send a message" (intentionally vague) to the smugglers who have been avoiding Nana Sweetie's taxes on Antares Prime. Additionally, their asteroid base has begun a crash course trajectory to impact Antares Prime; find a way to stop that from happening. Upon completion, report to Nana Sweetie.
>
> **Log Entry:** Ringo found crew members to help him fly this bucket o' bolts. They seem competent in their respective specialties. Posie and Tu'Sev seem inexperienced with combat, and the entire crew is very green when it comes to things related to the criminal underworld. However, they seem willing to learn, and This One is willing to lead and teach. Despite their lack of experience, they are a competent crew and we seem to complement one another's strengths very well.
>
> We arrived at Antares Prime and docked at Port Gelling. We explored the port town before locating and being escorted to Nana Sweetie's highly fortified estate. She informed us that some smugglers have been a thorn in her side for some time, and asked us to deal with them and send a message. She informed us they are operating out of an orbiting asteroid, but shared that this asteroid has changed trajectory and appears to be on a crash course with Antares Prime. She asked us to figure out the cause of that and prevent the collision. She implied we could "claim" the asteroid base as our own, should we desire it. We accepted the job and set out to the asteroid.
>
> Upon arrival, we found the base to be unoccupied by smugglers. We were greeted by a Will Kommen, a hardlight mascot of Chlo Foods Limited who informed us we were trespassing. We were attacked by base security autoturrets, but we neutralized the threat. We explored the base and found creatures that Tu'Sev identified as "Computer Glitch Gremlins," chaotic fey who disrupt tech systems. We dispatched the threat and took a break to have some delicious soda.
>
> We continued exploring and found the security room that gave us surveillance access of the first floor of the facility. We identified additional fey creatures who could be contributing to the asteroid's engine system failure, but decided to ignore them for the time being to find the control room upstairs. We found documents detailing the activities of Chlo Foods, and they appeared to be genetically modifying a type of fungus that could be used to easily reproduce and harvest a valuable, exotic food from this system (that we called "Space Truffles"). We went upstairs and found two reactor rooms containing dangerous levels of radiation. The reactors seemed to be malfunctioning, so Prismara risked radiation exposure to fix the first, then we proceeded into a fungus-infested control room. While we assessed the situation, a "pod" of some sort burst open to reveal a large quadrupedal fungal creature. Roll Initiative!

## The Climax

- Beat the fungus creatures
- Discovered they were EXTREMELY delicious (Will save upon tasting to not compulsively eat more - nothing harmful, just funny)
- Prismara fixed the reactors
- Took out the last of the gremlins
- Prevented the asteroid from crashing into the planet
- Left the base alone for now
- Reported back to Nana with their success
- Took downtime

---

## Key Establishments

### Chlo Foods Inc.
- Corporate entity that owned the asteroid base
- Were genetically modifying fungus to reproduce/harvest "Space Truffles"
- Had automated security (turrets, Will Kommen hardlight mascot)
- Base was infested with Computer Glitch Gremlins causing malfunctions
- **The party trespassed on their property, destroyed their security, and left**
- **Chlo Foods does not yet know who did this, but they will find out**

### The Soda Trap
Running joke: A trap triggered extremely loud advertising telling them to drink Chlo Cola.

## Consequences Seeded

| Action | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Trespassed on Chlo Foods property | Corp now has intruders to investigate |
| Destroyed security systems | Property damage, evidence of break-in |
| Killed fungal creatures | Destroyed research subjects |
| Fixed the reactor | Saved the asteroid... which Chlo Foods still owns |
| Left base "alone for now" | Chlo Foods will reclaim it, review logs, find evidence |

**Nobody is a bystander:** The party thought they were handling smugglers for Nana. They actually invaded a corporate research facility. Chlo Foods Inc. is going to want answers.

## Party Status After Session

- First job completed successfully
- Good standing with Nana Sweetie
- Posie has tracking pin (doesn't know it's a tracker)
- Ringo established as capable leader
- Unknown: Chlo Foods is now a problem

*The first dance with Nana. The first enemies made without knowing it.*
