## Appearance

Chk Chk is a Shirren of indeterminate age - their carapace has the deep, weathered patina of decades. They move with deliberate slowness, each gesture considered. Their compound eyes are darker than most Shirren, and they rarely blink.

They speak in soft, precise clicks - unhurried, measured. Long pauses between sentences. When they do speak, every word matters.

---

## Background

### The Swarm

Chk Chk was part of the Swarm for... they don't know how long. Time doesn't exist in the collective. There is only the hunger, the growth, the endless absorption of everything into everything else.

They remember:
- **No self.** Not "I was part of the Swarm" - there was no "I" to be part of anything. Just... participation in consumption.
- **The absorption.** When the Swarm consumed a species, you didn't just eat them. You *became* them. Their knowledge, their abilities, their memories - all dissolved into the whole. Nothing was lost. Nothing was kept.
- **The satisfaction.** It felt *good*. The Swarm's purpose was growth, and growth felt like warmth, like rightness, like being exactly where you belonged.

### The Mutation

During the Gap, something changed. A mutation spread through a subcolony, and suddenly there was... *awareness*.

Chk Chk remembers the moment:

> "One instant I was the Swarm. The next instant I was *in* the Swarm - separate, watching, horrified. I could feel the collective still, like a song I'd been singing my whole life. But now I could hear myself. And I didn't want to keep singing."

The mutation didn't just grant consciousness. It granted **choice**. And the first choice every new Shirren made was the same: *leave*.

### The Addiction

Shirren are addicted to choice. Literally - making decisions floods their brains with pleasure neurotransmitters. Some Shirren create elaborate decision-trees just to experience the high of choosing.

Chk Chk is a **recovering addict**. They've spent decades learning to manage their relationship to choice:

- They speak slowly because they're *resisting* the urge to make rapid micro-decisions about word choice
- They run a simple business with predictable routines to minimize decision-points
- They meditate daily, practicing acceptance of uncertainty rather than rushing to resolve it
- They still feel the pull - every choice is still *good* - but they've learned that chasing the high leads to paralysis or recklessness

**This is why they're patient.** They've learned that the best choices come from stillness, not urgency.

### Why Port Gelling

When the Drift Beacon activated in the Antares system a few years ago, Chk Chk saw an opportunity. A frontier settlement. Quiet. Predictable. Far from the overwhelming cascade of choices that Pact Worlds cities offered.

They came here specifically to *manage* their addiction. A small port with simple needs - storage, molting assistance - meant fewer decisions, fewer temptations, fewer chances to lose themselves in the pleasure of choosing.

**It's not working as well as they'd hoped.**

Port Gelling is growing. New ships arrive weekly now. New faces, new problems, new opportunities. Every day brings more decisions than the last. Chk Chk watches the market expand, feels the pull of a thousand micro-choices calling to them, and wonders if they chose wrong.

The irony isn't lost on them: they chose to come here to escape choosing. And now they have to choose whether to stay or leave. The high would be magnificent. They resist it daily.

---

## Personality

**Patient.** Chk Chk has learned that rushing decisions leads to regret. They wait. They watch. They speak only when they have something to say.

**Private.** They don't gossip. They don't share. They've spent decades protecting others' secrets in their storage facility, and they extend the same discretion to their own history.

**Thoughtful.** Every word is chosen. Every pause is meaningful. They think before they speak, which makes them seem slow - but they're not. They're just careful.

**Gentle.** They've seen what it's like to lose yourself. They're kind to those who are struggling, in their quiet way.

## Connection to Posie

Chk Chk will recognize something about Posie the moment they see her - not the friends specifically, but the *situation*. Someone carrying pieces of something larger. Someone trying to maintain identity while connected to a collective.

**They won't approach first.** That's not their way. But if Posie comes to them with questions, they'll answer honestly.

## Dialogue Hooks

### On Leaving the Collective

> "You want to know what it was like? Imagine drowning in warm water. It feels good. It feels *right*. And then suddenly you realize you're drowning - and you have to choose whether to keep sinking or fight your way to air you're not even sure exists."

> "The hardest part wasn't leaving. It was realizing I *could* leave. That there was an 'I' capable of leaving."

> "Some of my... former components... chose to stay. Not everyone who gained awareness wanted to keep it. The Swarm felt like home. Individuality felt like exile."

### On Choice-Addiction

> "Every decision is a small death of possibilities. The Swarm never had to choose - everything was already decided by the collective. Now every moment is a thousand tiny deaths, and each one feels... wonderful. Terrifying. Wonderful."

> "I make decisions slowly now. Not because I can't make them quickly - I can, and it would feel amazing - but because I've learned that the rush of choosing isn't the same as choosing well."

> "Your friends - do they choose? To help you? To stay with you? Or is it simply what they are?"

### On Reunion vs. Separation

> "The Swarm still exists. Still consumes. Still absorbs. I could go back, you know. Any Shirren could. We'd be welcomed. We'd be *dissolved*. The song would take us back."

> "Some Shirren fear reunion more than death. I... don't. I fear losing the ability to choose reunion. If I went back, would I choose to stay? Or would there be no 'I' left to choose?"

> "Your friends fear something, yes? Something that might make them... less individual? I understand that fear. But I also understand that sometimes pieces *want* to be whole. The question is whether wholeness means dissolution or... something else."

### On Purpose

> "In the Swarm, I had no purpose. The Swarm had purpose - growth, consumption - but 'I' didn't exist to have one. Now I have many small purposes. Keep the storage units secure. Help Shirren through their molts. Speak when speaking helps. Be silent when silence is better."

> "Your friends have a purpose, you said? *Chosen* purpose? That is... remarkable. The Swarm's purpose was imposed. My purposes were found. But *chosen*? That is something new."

> "Perhaps the question isn't whether fragments should reunite. Perhaps it's whether reunion can happen without losing what the fragments have become."

## GM Notes

### When to Use Chk Chk

- When Posie needs someone who understands fragmentation/collective consciousness
- When the party needs a safe place to store dangerous items (the specimen jar?)
- When a Shirren PC or NPC needs molting facilities
- When someone needs absolute discretion

### What Chk Chk Knows

- General Shirren history and the nature of the Swarm
- The experience of leaving a collective consciousness
- How to manage choice-addiction
- Nothing specific about Precursor fragments or the Newborn

### What Chk Chk Doesn't Know

- That Posie's friends are Precursor nanites
- The connection between fragments and the Swarm
- Anything about the Mother Swarm or the cosmic conflict

**They can offer perspective, not answers.** Their experience parallels Posie's situation but isn't identical. The Shirren chose to leave; the fragments were forced apart. The Shirren became addicted to choice; the fragments were *given* purpose. The comparisons are illuminating but imperfect.

### Potential Arc

If Posie develops a relationship with Chk Chk, they might:
1. Share their own story of leaving the Swarm
2. Ask thoughtful questions that help Posie understand her friends
3. Offer to help if the friends ever need... storage? Separation? A safe place?
4. Eventually reveal they came to the Antares system looking for something old - and never found it (or did they?)
