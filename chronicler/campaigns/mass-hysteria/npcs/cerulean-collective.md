# The Cerulean Collective

> The organization Ringo ran from. The debt he can never truly pay.

---

## Overview

The Cerulean Collective is a criminal syndicate with legitimate business fronts. They operate across multiple systems, dealing in whatever makes money - smuggling, assassination, influence peddling, money laundering. They're not a cartel or a gang. They're a *collective* - a network of specialists who share resources and opportunities.

Ringo was one of those specialists. Until he refused to kill a child.

## Known Leadership

### Director Nox

**Role:** The head of the Collective - or one of them.

**Key Trait:** Multiple identities. "Other faces in many pies."

**What This Means:**
- Director Nox may not be a single person
- Or Nox is a single person with many disguises
- The Collective's leadership is deliberately obscured
- Even members may not know who they're really working for

**Appearance:** Unknown. Ringo may have met one face of Nox without knowing who it was.

### The Opulent (Charity)

**Role:** Head of the underworld operations - the overtly criminal side.

**Appearance:** Human woman, plainly dressed despite her title. Pleasant demeanor, but no-nonsense.

**Personality:** The "Opulent" title is ironic or inherited. Charity dresses simply and speaks directly. She handles the dirty work and doesn't pretend otherwise.

**Method:** Direct, practical, efficient. If something needs doing, it gets done. If someone needs removing, they get removed. No games, no drama.

## The Organization

### Structure (Suspected)

The Collective operates as a network, not a hierarchy:

**The Directors:** Overall leadership (Director Nox, possibly others)
**The Titles:** Department heads (The Opulent/Charity for underworld ops)
**The Specialists:** Operators like Jax Lionheart was - skilled individuals on retainer
**The Associates:** Contractors, informants, temporary assets

### Operations

**Known Activities:**
- Assassination (Ringo's specialty)
- Money laundering (the Lionheart parents' specialty)
- Smuggling
- Influence peddling
- Information brokering

**Business Fronts:**
- **Chlo Foods Inc.** - Agricultural megacorp (subsidiary of a shell corp of a shell corp...)
- Multiple other legitimate businesses across the galaxy
- The "Collective" name suggests investment or business operations
- They have legitimate presence in most major systems

**The Chlo Foods Connection:**
Chlo Foods is buried several layers deep in Collective ownership. Most Chlo Foods employees have no idea who really owns them. But when reports flow upward - especially reports about security incidents, trespassers, and property damage - someone in the chain eventually reviews them. Someone who might recognize familiar names or faces.

### Resources

**The Collective Has:**
- Galaxy-wide reach
- Multiple operatives
- Significant funding
- Legal cover through business fronts
- Information networks
- Long memory

**The Collective Doesn't Have:**
- Unlimited attention (Ringo is one problem among many)
- Perfect information (they haven't found him yet)
- Patience forever (eventually they'll prioritize this)

## The Jax Lionheart Problem

### What Happened

Ringo (then Jax Lionheart) was a Collective specialist - an operator blessed by Meyel, skilled at what the Collective called "the Dance." He did their work. He believed the goddess guided his steps.

Then they ordered him to kill Julian Thorne.

Julian Thorne was a child.

Jax refused. Then he ran.

### What They Lost

**Operational Asset:** A skilled operative with divine luck
**Investment:** Years of training and deployment
**Reliability:** If Jax can refuse, others might too
**Face:** An asset walking away is an insult

### What They Want

**Official:** The bounty on Jax Lionheart. They want him captured or killed.

**Practical:** They want the problem resolved. Whether that means bringing him back, eliminating him, or something else depends on circumstances.

**Symbolic:** They want to demonstrate that nobody walks away from the Collective.

## The Julian Thorne Mystery

Why did the Cerulean Collective want a child dead?

**This question is unanswered.** It's the thread that could unravel everything about Ringo's past and the Collective's true nature.

### Possibilities

**Julian Was a Threat:**
- Child of someone powerful who wanted them eliminated
- Heir who needed to disappear for succession purposes
- Somehow dangerous despite being young

**Julian Was Evidence:**
- Witnessed something
- Knew something
- Was evidence of something (parentage, crime, etc.)

**Julian Was a Message:**
- Killing them would hurt someone the Collective wanted to hurt
- The death itself was the point, not the child

**Julian Was a Test:**
- The Collective was testing Jax's loyalty
- They suspected he was compromised
- The mission was designed to fail

**Julian Was Important:**
- Connected to something larger
- Part of a prophecy, inheritance, or plan
- More than they appeared

*Let the player discover this through play.*

## The Lionheart Connection

Ringo's parents - Boharaff and Jasumee Lionheart - are still laundering money for the Collective.

### Their Situation

**Why They're Alive:** They're useful. The Collective doesn't waste assets.

**Why They Don't Leave:** Where would they go? The Collective knows their skills. They're too deep to get out.

**What They Know:** Probably that their son is wanted. Possibly that he's alive. They may have been questioned when he disappeared.

### The Leverage

If the Collective discovers where Ringo is, his parents become leverage:
- "Come back, or we visit your family"
- "Your parents are transferring some funds. Come pick them up in person."
- Or simply: "We told them you're dead. It's more convenient that way."

## Threat Assessment

### Why They're Not an Immediate Threat

**Distance:** The Collective operates galaxy-wide, but Antares is newly opened. Their presence here is limited.

**Priority:** Ringo is one problem among many. #4 on a bounty board, not #1 on their operations list.

**Information:** They don't know where he is or that he's "Ringo Stryx" now.

**Method:** They're patient. They'll find him eventually, but they're not rushing.

### Why They Will Become a Threat

**Time:** Eventually, data will connect Ringo to Jax.

**Money:** The bounty motivates hunters who might report to the Collective.

**Networks:** They have informants everywhere. Someone will notice.

**Memory:** The Collective doesn't forget. They don't forgive.

---

## Relationship to Other Factions

### The Bounty Hunters

**Lyra, Gaxxus, Lysander:** Independent operators hunting the bounty. Not Collective agents (probably). But the Collective might:
- Approach them with information
- Buy the bounty from whoever catches Jax
- Use them as tools without revealing involvement

### Nana Sweetie

**Unknown Connection:** Does the Collective operate in Antares? Do they have arrangements with Nana? Are they rivals?

**Potential Conflict:** If Ringo is valuable to Nana, the Collective wanting him creates a problem. Nana doesn't share assets.

### Chlo Foods Inc. (OWNED BY COLLECTIVE)

**The Connection:** Chlo Foods is a Collective subsidiary, buried under layers of shell corporations and holding companies. Most Chlo Foods employees don't know this.

**The Situation:** The party invaded a Chlo Foods facility on their first job. They trespassed, destroyed property, killed research subjects, and left. Chlo Foods is investigating. When their report reaches the right desk in the Collective...

**The Irony:** Ringo ran to the edge of known space. On day one, he walked into a building owned by the people hunting him.

**Timeline:**
1. Chlo Foods investigates the asteroid incident
2. Report flows upward through shell companies
3. Someone recognizes "Mass Hysteria" or Ringo's face
4. The Collective suddenly knows exactly where Jax Lionheart is

**This hasn't happened yet.** But it will.

### Zenithcorp

**Corporate Distance:** Zenithcorp is a *rival* to the Collective's business interests, not a subsidiary.

**Potential Complication:** If Lysander Southpaw (Zenithcorp) and the Collective both want Ringo, they might compete - or they might cooperate. Enemies of enemies and all that.

## GM Notes

### When to Introduce

The Collective should be background pressure, not immediate threat:
- **Early game:** Mentioned in Ringo's backstory. The reason for the bounty.
- **Mid game:** Rumors that the Collective is asking questions. Someone approached the hunters.
- **Late game:** Direct contact. An agent of the Collective appears. Choices must be made.

### Playing the Collective

**Not Cartoonish Evil:** They're not mustache-twirling villains. They're a business. Ringo cost them an asset and embarrassed them. That's the problem, not personal hatred.

**Patient and Professional:** They don't rush. They don't threaten needlessly. They solve problems efficiently.

**Morally Gray:** Some of what they do is terrible. Some is just... business. The Julian Thorne job was an outlier (or was it?).

### The Julian Question

Don't resolve this too quickly. The mystery of why they wanted a child dead should linger. When it's finally answered, it should recontextualize everything.

**Options:**
- Let the player decide what Julian was
- Reveal it as part of a larger arc
- Connect it to other campaign elements (Precursors? Newborn? Something else?)

## Potential Encounters

### The Message

Someone delivers a message from the Collective. Not a threat - just: "We know where you are. We're watching. When we're ready, we'll talk."

**Purpose:** Establish that they've found him. Start the clock.

### The Offer

A Collective representative approaches with terms: "Come back. One last job. Then you're free."

**Purpose:** Temptation. Trust. What do they really want?

### The Parents

The Lionhearts reach out. "Your mother wants to see you. Please come home."

**Purpose:** Is it a trap? Is it genuine? Can Ringo risk either answer?

### The Truth

Someone knows what Julian Thorne was. What they say changes everything.

**Purpose:** The mystery resolves. Ringo has to choose what to do with the truth.

## Sample Dialogue

**Director Nox (or a representative):**
> "Jax Lionheart. You've been missed. Not in the emotional sense, of course. More in the accounting sense. You represent an unresolved liability."

**The Opulent (Charity):**
> "I don't do threats. Threats are for people who can't deliver. I'm just here to explain your options. You have fewer than you think."

**A Collective Operative:**
> "The Collective doesn't chase. We wait. Eventually, everyone comes to us - or we come to them. You chose the second option."

*They're not hunting him. They're waiting for him. There's a difference.*
