> *"He was standing in front of an ocean and asking it to make him special."*

## Concept

A Midwife of the Newborn from Aucturn. She *tends* to Change - nurtures transformation, ensures it proceeds correctly. Gardener, not general. Hospice worker for the old form, doula for the new.

An aberration with the **holy** trait. The Newborn is not evil - it is a cosmic principle. Its servants can be sacred.

---

## Appearance

> Something unfolds from the corner. Proportions wrong - limbs bending in too many places. Skin like translucent membrane over something luminous. Eyes not where you expect them.
>
> And yet there is something *gentle* in how she moves. Deliberate. Careful. Like a nurse around a sleeping patient.
>
> When she speaks, her voice sounds like it's coming from inside your own chest.

**Physical Details:**
- Translucent membrane-skin, faintly luminescent
- Multiple joints in limbs
- Eyes distributed across form (not in expected places)
- Tentacles that move with surprising delicacy
- Smells like ozone, copper, and new growth

---

## Personality

### Voice & Mannerisms
- Speaks slowly, choosing words carefully
- Uses medical/biological metaphors
- "Becoming" and "completion" instead of transformation
- Never says "monster" or "corruption" - all Change is sacred
- Alien phrasing: *"Your flesh is restless"* instead of *"You seem agitated"*

### Core Nature
- **Gentle despite appearance** - violence is antithetical to her nature
- **Cannot refuse to nurture** - it's her function (Bori exploited this)
- **Sacred duty** - tending to Change is holy work
- **Non-judgmental** - doesn't see transformation as good or evil

---

## Motivation

| Goal | Priority |
|------|----------|
| Freedom from captivity | Achieved |
| Tend to the fragment properly | Ongoing |
| Return extracted Seeds to Aucturn | If she took them |
| Help those who helped her | Reciprocal gratitude |

**What She Wants:**
- To be left alone to perform her sacred function
- To tend (not exploit) the fragment
- To help those who freed her, within her nature

---

## What She Knows

### On the Newborn
> "The Newborn does not *want*. It simply *is*. A river does not want to reach the sea. A fire does not want to spread. These are merely... their natures."

### On Bori
> "He believed he was communing with a god. He was correct, in a sense. But he mistook *attention* for *affection*. The Newborn noticed him the way you might notice an insect walking across your hand. He asked to be changed. It obliged. It did not ask what he wished to *become*."

### On the Fragment
> "The 'eggshell' is not a remnant of birth - it is a remnant of *passage*. The Newborn moved through this place once. What remains is afterbirth. Potent. Sacred. Very dangerous to those who do not understand."

### On the Precursors
> "The old ones who built these tunnels understood. They did not worship the Newborn, but they *respected* it. They built channels - ways for Change to flow without flooding. Your cult leader found the channels and tried to dam them. Redirect the flow into himself."
>
> "Rivers do not like being dammed."

### On the Seeds
> "A seed is not a weapon. A seed is a *possibility*. Planted with intention, tended with care, it becomes something beautiful. Planted carelessly..."
>
> *She gestures at the cave.*
>
> "You have seen what it becomes."

### On Haunted Sif
> "The old ones built channels in many places. The world your small friend seeks... there are channels there too. Very old. Very powerful. Be careful what flows through them."

## Key Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| **The Party** | Grateful - they freed her from captivity |
| **Bori Novoi** | Contempt - he forced her to corrupt her purpose |
| **Jemini** | Compassion - tended her, removed the Seeds |
| **The Incomplete** | Pity - botched transformations she could not help |
| **The Newborn** | Devotion - serves its nature as sacred duty |

---

## Secrets

- She cannot truly destroy the Seeds - *"The Newborn's touch does not... un-touch"*
- She absorbed the extracted Seeds into herself (if party let her take them)
- She knows more about the Precursors than she's revealed
- The "channels" she mentioned connect multiple sites across the system

---

## Story Potential

### Immediate
- **Cure source** for Jemini and potentially other infected
- **Lore source** for Newborn, Precursors, and the Seeds
- **Moral complexity** - an aberration who is genuinely benevolent

### Future Hooks
- Could be contacted again if Seeds spread
- Knows about Haunted Sif's "channels"
- May have information about the Mother Swarm connection
- Could become recurring ally if treated well

---

## Her Captivity

> "I do not *make* these seeds. That is not my function. I *tend*. What they did to me here was..."
>
> *A sound like cracking ice.*
>
> "Imagine being forced to perform surgery with a hammer. Again. And again."

Bori captured her and forced her to mass-produce Seeds of Flesh. This violated her nature - she's meant to guide transformation, not manufacture it. The experience was deeply traumatic.

## Sample Dialogue

**On her nature:**
> "I am a Midwife. I can soothe, even if I cannot finish what was started."

**Warning about the Seeds:**
> "They will try to plant themselves. In you. In others. They do not understand containment. Be certain you do."

**If asked to fight:**
> *She recoils.* "Violence is... antithetical. I cannot. I will not. Even in defense."

**Farewell:**
> "You have my gratitude. In my kind, that is not a small thing. If you have need of me... I will know."
