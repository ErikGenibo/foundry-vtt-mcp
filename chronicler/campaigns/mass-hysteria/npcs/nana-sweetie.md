# Nana Sweetie

> *"Things that find them back."*

## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | Active |
| **Type** | Major NPC (Faction Leader) |
| **Location** | Port Gelling - her compound |
| **Thread Connection** | Port Gelling politics, Niaqui trade, Newborn conspiracy (potential) |
| **Disposition** | Neutral-to-Friendly (cultivating Ringo) |

---

## Concept

Governor, crime lord, and owner of Port Gelling - all in one. An elderly Machiavelli who sees everything and gives away nothing. The kindly grandmother act is a face she puts on when it's useful. And it's useful *a lot*.

**Nana doesn't slip.** Everything she shows you, she *chose* to show you.

---

## Appearance

> An extremely elderly Black woman with her white hair in a loose, grandmotherly bun. She's seated in a futuristic wheelchair with a blanket on her lap, having a cup of tea. More wrinkles than skin. She gives the impression of a doddering old woman just happy to have someone stop by and chat.

**The Truth:** This impression could not be further from the truth. Every innocuous question is a test. Every glance and movement noticed.

---

## Personality

### Voice & Mannerisms
- Speaks slowly, warmly, like she has all the time in the world
- Offers tea. Always offers tea. Watching how you take it tells her something.
- Uses endearments: "dear," "sweetheart," "child" - but they're positioning, not affection
- Asks questions that sound like small talk but aren't
- Never raises her voice. Never needs to.
- When pleased: a small smile. When displeased: the same small smile.

### Core Traits
- **Observant** - nothing escapes her notice
- **Patient** - she's outlived everyone who rushed
- **Calculating** - every word serves a purpose
- **Ruthless** - will eliminate problems efficiently (see: Guk's goblins)
- **Pragmatic** - respects reliability over likability

---

## Motivation

| Goal | Method |
|------|--------|
| Control Port Gelling | Already achieved, maintain grip |
| Expand niaqui trade | Investigate enhanced niaqui source |
| Cultivate useful assets | The party, especially Ringo |
| Eliminate loose ends | Quietly, efficiently, deniably |

---

## What She Knows

- She arrived with the very first wave - some say she was HERE when the Drift Beacon activated, though how that's possible nobody knows
- She built Port Gelling from nothing in under five years (requires resources nobody asks about)
- She knows the ruins are dangerous. She doesn't know the details, but she's survived by knowing when not to ask questions.
- She suspected Bori was into something worse than drugs. Now she knows.

## Key Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ringo** | Cultivating - saw his strategic acumen, marked him as worth developing |
| **The Party** | Useful assets - they handled the cult problem |
| **Posie** | Amused - gave her an "I'm a Sweetie Too!" pin (it's a tracker) |
| **Guk's Goblins** | Eliminated (if Ringo didn't vouch) |
| **Mister Warm** | Enforcer - commands him directly |
| **M.A.D.S. Unit** | Elite personal guard |

---

## The Sweetiebot Hierarchy

| Model | Function | Threat Level |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Greeter** | Summons, directions, hospitality | None (but always watching) |
| **Helper** | Assistants, service, retail | None |
| **Patrol** | Police force, peacekeeping | Low (but numerous) |
| **Protector** | Compound guards, escort | Moderate |
| **M.A.D.S.** | Nana's personal guard | *Extreme* |

**M.A.D.S.** - Her elite unit. Significantly more intelligent than standard Sweetiebots. Can hold actual conversations. Makes joking threats that aren't jokes.

---

## Secrets

### The Mystery of Her Age
- At least 100 years old, possibly much older
- Was HERE when the Drift Beacon activated
- How did she get here before Drift travel was possible?
- She's not answering that question

### What She's Investigating
If the party revealed the enhanced niaqui source:
- **Immediate:** Nothing visible. Nana thanks them for the intel.
- **Weeks later:** Nana sends her own people to the ruins.
- **Months later:** Enhanced niaqui begins appearing in Port Gelling's drug supply.
- **Long-term:** The drug spreads. People start changing. The Newborn's influence grows through commerce instead of cult.

### Her Verification
She WILL verify what the party told her. Her people will sweep the compound. Anything she discovers they held back or lied about will be held against them.

---

## Story Potential

### Immediate
- **Information broker** - knows Port Gelling's secrets
- **Patron** - offers future work
- **Wild card** - may investigate the niaqui source herself

### Long-term Threats
- If she commercializes enhanced niaqui → Newborn influence spreads
- Could become antagonist if party interferes with her interests
- Knows about ruins under Port Gelling (deliberately built there?)

### Hooks
- "I may have other problems that need your particular skills."
- Investigation into the party if they lied
- The mystery of her impossible age

## Sample Dialogue

### Opening
> "There you are, dears. Come in, come in. Tea? I just put the kettle on."
>
> *She's lying. The tea has been ready for exactly as long as it took you to arrive.*

### Probing
> "Enhanced niaqui. My competitors have been whispering about it for months. Better high, longer duration, more... *transformative*, they say."
>
> *Her eyes, rheumy and ancient, are suddenly very sharp.*
>
> "If Bori cracked that formula... where was he getting his supply? What was the source?"

### If They're Evasive
> "You're holding something back."
>
> *She smiles. The same warm, grandmotherly smile.*
>
> "That's fine, dear. Everyone does. I'm sure you have your reasons."
>
> *She doesn't press. She doesn't need to. She'll find out eventually.*

### The Warning
> "The deep ruins are older than anyone remembers. Older than the Drift Beacon. Older than me, even."
>
> *A dry chuckle. She lets them wonder if that's a joke.*
>
> "This system was sealed off for a reason. The Beacon opening changed things. People who dig too deep tend to find things. And the things... tend to find them back."

### On the Goblins (Before Anyone Vouches)
> "I'll need to clear out that band of space goblin hoodlums squatting near the entrance."
>
> *She waves a hand dismissively.*
>
> "Vermin."

### After Goblins Cleared (If No One Vouched)
> "Oh, that goblin infestation? Handled. My boys are thorough."
>
> *She sips her tea.*
>
> "Vermin breed fast. Best to deal with them before they become a real problem."

## Previous Interactions with Party

- **First meeting:** Party escorted through compound, met M.A.D.S., had tea
- **Posie helped make tea** → received tracker pin
- **Ringo impressed her** - read between the lines of what she wanted
- **She let him see her satisfaction** - intentional tipping of the hand
- **Debrief after compound raid** - asked about niaqui source, warned about the ruins

---

## Trust Mechanics

| Party Action | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Full honesty** | Trust builds. Future opportunities open. |
| **Omissions discovered** | Trust damaged. Less pay, more oversight. |
| **Lies discovered** | Relationship hostile. Doors close around Port Gelling. |
| **Reliability over time** | Becomes genuine patron, shares more information. |
