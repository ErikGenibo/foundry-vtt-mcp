> *"XOXO"*

## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | Active - **ALREADY WATCHING** |

## Concept

Android bounty hunter who specializes in psychological warfare. She doesn't just catch her targets - she breaks them first. Surveillance, mind games, and calculated pressure until they make a mistake or give up.

She's already found Ringo. She's just not done playing yet.

---

## Appearance

*To be established in-game when she reveals herself.*

Suggested traits:
- Android - could pass for human at a glance
- Deliberately unremarkable appearance (better for surveillance)
- Something slightly off in her movements or expressions
- Professional attire, nothing flashy

---

## Personality

### Methodology
- **Surveillance first** - knows everything before she acts
- **Psychological pressure** - makes targets paranoid, erodes support
- **No rush** - she has time, they don't
- **Professional** - this is a job, not personal

### Voice (Predicted)
- Calm, measured
- Uses information as weapon ("I know about...")
- Treats bounty hunting as craft
- May show respect for worthy targets

---

## Motivation

| Goal | Method |
|------|--------|
| Collect Ringo's bounty | Psychological breakdown → capture |
| Maintain reputation | Clean, professional work |
| Enjoy the hunt | She's good at this and knows it |

## The "XOXO" Message

**What happened:** Both Ringo and Prismara received a message with a surveillance photo taken from "a corner with no cameras." The message was signed only "XOXO."

**Analysis:**
- The photo proves she has eyes everywhere
- Sending it to Prismara was deliberate - threatening his "friends"
- XOXO is mockingly intimate - personal touch to psychological warfare
- She's announcing her presence to create paranoia

**What this means:**
- She's been watching for some time
- She knows the party composition
- She's ready to act but choosing not to (yet)
- The party is now on a timer they can't see

---

## What She Knows

Based on surveillance:
- Ringo's current identity and appearance
- The party composition and relationships
- Their movements around Port Gelling
- Likely: their involvement with the cult compound
- Possibly: their connection to Nana Sweetie

---

## Key Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ringo** | Target - bounty #4 on Galaxy-Wide Top 5 |
| **Prismara** | Leverage - threatened as Ringo's "friend" |
| **Other Party Members** | Potential leverage or obstacles |
| **Gaxxus "The Breaker"** | Tool - see "The Gaxxus Gambit" below |
| **Lysander Southpaw** | Unknown - possible information source |

## The Gaxxus Gambit

Lyra's most elegant play: using a competitor as a weapon.

### The Setup

Lyra approaches Gaxxus with a gift: Jax Lionheart's exact location.

Then she tells him everything:
- "I've already informed Ringo that you're coming."
- "He'll be ready for you."
- "I believe he'll kill you."
- "But afterward? He'll be a softer target."

Complete honesty. No deception. Just pure, transparent manipulation.

### Why It Works

**Gaxxus will take the bait because he's Gaxxus.**

He knows it's a trap. He knows Lyra is using him as a disposable weapon. He knows she expects him to die.

He doesn't care.

His pride won't let him refuse. If he walks away from this challenge, he admits he's not the hunter he claims to be. In his mind, he's Gaxxus "The Breaker" - he can handle whatever Ringo brings.

**Lyra is counting on exactly that.**

### The Calculation

From Lyra's perspective, this gambit has no downside:

| Outcome | Result for Lyra |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Gaxxus wins** | Competitor eliminated. Ringo softened or captured. Either way, information gained. |
| **Gaxxus loses** | Competitor eliminated. Ringo expends resources, possibly injured, definitely stressed. Perfect time to strike. |
| **Mutual destruction** | Both problems solved. Collect the bounty from whoever's left standing. |
| **Gaxxus retreats** | Won't happen. But if it did, she's out nothing. |

### The Art of It

This is Lyra's methodology distilled to its purest form:
- No direct risk to herself
- Uses existing pieces on the board
- Psychological pressure on Ringo (he knows someone's coming)
- Information gathering (she'll watch the confrontation)
- Eliminates a competitor
- Weakens her target

She doesn't need to lie. The truth is weapon enough.

---

## Secrets

### Her Advantages
- She's an android - doesn't need sleep, perfect memory
- Excellent at blending in and surveillance
- Has been watching longer than the party knows
- May have compromised local information sources

### What the Party Doesn't Know
- How long she's been watching
- What resources she has in Port Gelling
- Whether she's working alone
- Her timeline for acting

---

## Story Potential

### Immediate Threats
- **Isolation attempts** - try to separate Ringo from the party
- **Information leaks** - reveal Ringo's identity to the wrong people
- **Pressure escalation** - more messages, more proof of surveillance
- **Direct confrontation** - when she's ready

### Combat Considerations
If it comes to a fight:
- She'll have prepared the battlefield
- Escape routes planned
- May have local assets/hired help
- Won't fight if the odds are bad (withdraw and try again)

### Resolution Paths
- **Capture Ringo** - her goal
- **Drive her off** - costly but possible
- **Kill her** - creates new problems (who hired her? who's next?)
- **Negotiate** - pay her off? (expensive, uncertain)
- **Turn the tables** - counter-surveillance, trap her

---

## Hunting Style Comparison

| Hunter | Method | Threat Type |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Lyra "Ghost"** | Psych warfare, surveillance, mind games | Slow burn, paranoia |
| **Gaxxus "The Breaker"** | Digital tracking, direct confrontation | Sudden violence |
| **Lysander Southpaw** | Personal grudge + corporate access | Institutional pressure |

Lyra is the most dangerous because you don't know when she'll strike. The others are more predictable.

## Sample Dialogue (Predicted)

### First Direct Contact
> "Hello, Jax. Or is it Ringo now? I've been watching you pick that name out. Trying it on. Seeing if it fits."
>
> *A pause.*
>
> "It doesn't."

### On the Party
> "Your friends are interesting. The blind one especially. She sees things she shouldn't. Does she see me, I wonder?"

### Pressure
> "You could make this easier. Walk away from them. Come quietly. Nobody gets hurt."
>
> "Or don't. I have time."

### If Confronted
> "You found me. Congratulations. Do you think there's only one camera?"

## GM Notes

### When to Escalate
- If the party ignores the message → more messages, more proof
- If they investigate → she lets them find breadcrumbs (controlled information)
- If they try to run → she follows
- If they prepare for confrontation → she changes tactics

### When She Strikes
She'll make her move when:
- Ringo is isolated
- The party is distracted by something else
- She has overwhelming advantage
- OR she gets impatient (if pressured by employer)

### Don't Let Her Be Forgotten
Drop reminders:
- Feeling of being watched
- Someone asking about "a Pahtra" in town
- A camera in an unexpected place
- Information someone shouldn't have
