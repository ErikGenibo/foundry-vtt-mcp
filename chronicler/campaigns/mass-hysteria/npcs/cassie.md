## Backstory

### The Early Days
Cassie was among the first wave of settlers when the Drift Beacon opened Antares to travel - less than five years ago.

> "You know how long this system was cut off? Before the Beacon, nobody could get here. Nobody even knew it was HERE. And then suddenly we could Drift in, and everyone wanted a piece of it."

### Talven (Jemini's Father)
> "He was one of the first xenoarchaeologists to arrive. Came here specifically to study the pre-Gap ruins. That's how we met."
>
> "He was only here six months before he started changing. Not physically - just... his priorities. He'd stay out at the ruins for days. Started talking about 'connections' and 'the pattern.' And then one day he walked into the desert."
>
> "I was pregnant with Jemini. He never even knew."

**Talven's fate:** Deliberately vague. He may be dead, transformed, or still out there somewhere.

### The Pattern
Before he left, Talven told Cassie something:

> "He told me something. Said he'd finally understood what the ruins were FOR. He said they were 'channels.' For something to flow through. Something that wasn't supposed to flow anymore, but was starting to again."

---

## What She Knows

### The Ruins
> "There are at least three sites that the survey teams found. Bori's compound is built near one - I don't think that's a coincidence. There's another about fifty klicks east - completely collapsed, but you can see the outline from the air."

### Under Port Gelling
> "When Nana was building Port Gelling, the construction crews hit something. Old. Sealed. She had them build around it. Whether she knows what's down there, I couldn't say. But the foundations of this port go down farther than they should."

### The Survey Teams
> "Some of the early survey teams went into the ruins. Pre-Gap structures - older than anyone could date. Most of them came back fine. Most."
>
> "The ones who didn't come back fine... they'd talk about patterns. Rhythms. One guy said the walls were breathing. We thought it was gas exposure. Bad air in sealed spaces."

## Key Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Jemini** | Daughter - desperate to save, guilty for driving her away |
| **Talven** | Deceased husband (probably) - lost to the ruins |
| **The Party** | Grateful clients - hired them to rescue Jemini |
| **Nana Sweetie** | Wary respect - Nana controls Port Gelling |

---

## Secrets

### What She Hasn't Shared
- Full extent of what Talven discovered
- Her suspicions about what's under Port Gelling
- The fact that Jemini never knew her father
- How much she blames herself for Jemini joining the cult

### Why She Stays Silent
- Talking about it feels like inviting it in
- Terrified Jemini will follow Talven's path
- Some knowledge isn't worth having

---

## Story Potential

### Immediate
- **Information source** on Precursor ruins (if pushed)
- **Emotional anchor** for Jemini's recovery
- **Complication** - guilt and fear may make her difficult

### Future Hooks
- What happened to Talven? (Investigation possibility)
- What's under Port Gelling? (Major reveal)
- Can she reconcile with Jemini? (Character development)
- Could she become a recurring ally/patron?

---

## Her Guilt (Jemini)

> "She said I was suffocating her. That I never let her be anything but my daughter."
>
> *Guilt. Cassie pushed too hard; Jemini ran to someone who made her feel special.*

Cassie tried so hard to protect Jemini from Talven's fate that she drove her daughter away. The cult offered what Cassie wouldn't: the chance to be part of something larger, to matter.

---

## Sample Dialogue

### On Jemini
> "She wasn't like this before she left. Cold, yes. Angry, yes. But not... empty."

### On the Past (If Pushed)
> "There's something under this planet. I don't know what. I don't WANT to know. But it's been here since before the Gap. Maybe since before there was anyone to remember."

### On Talven
> *A sad smile.*
>
> "He was brilliant. Obsessive, but brilliant. He believed the ruins were connected somehow - that they were all part of the same structure, spread across the whole system."

### The Warning
> "Four years ago, I thought he was raving. Now I'm not so sure."

---

## Information Unlocks

| DC | What She Reveals |
|----|------------------|
| Diplomacy 16 | The ruins, the survey teams, what happened to them |
| Diplomacy 18 | Talven's discoveries, the "channels" |
| Diplomacy 20+ | What's under Port Gelling, Nana's deliberate construction |
| Critical Success | Everything, including her fears about Jemini following Talven |

She won't volunteer any of this. She has to be pushed.

---

## GM Notes

### Don't Info-Dump
Let this come out naturally if players ask the right questions. Cassie is a reluctant source - every piece of information is pulled from her.

### Talven as Future Hook
His fate is deliberately vague. Options:
- Dead in the ruins
- Transformed by Newborn contact
- Still alive, somewhere in the system
- Became something else entirely

### Jemini Relationship
Post-cure, the mother-daughter dynamic is broken but not gone. Jemini is empty and grieving. Cassie is guilty and desperate. Neither knows how to bridge the gap.
