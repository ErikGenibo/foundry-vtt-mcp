## Overview

Chlo Foods Inc. is a mid-tier agricultural megacorp specializing in exotic food production, genetic modification, and frontier system expansion. They're not evil. They're not good. They're a corporation - profit-driven, legally aggressive, and very unhappy about what happened to their Antares research facility.

**The party's first corporate enemy.** Made on day one, without even realizing it.

---

## The Hidden Truth

**Chlo Foods is owned by the Cerulean Collective.**

Not directly - there are shell corporations, holding companies, and layers of legal obfuscation between "Chlo Foods Inc." and "Cerulean Collective Inc." But if you trace the ownership chain far enough, you find the same criminal syndicate that Ringo ran from.

**What This Means:**
- The party made enemies with Ringo's former employers without knowing it
- When Chlo Foods investigates the asteroid incident, that information flows upward
- If they identify Ringo, someone in the chain will recognize the name "Jax Lionheart"
- The Collective doesn't know Ringo is in the Antares system - but Chlo Foods might tell them

**Who Knows:**
- Director Hashimoto: Probably doesn't know. She's a career corporate climber, not Collective inner circle.
- Will Kommen: Definitely doesn't know. He's an AI mascot.
- Someone higher up: Will eventually connect the dots.

**The Irony:**
Ringo ran to the edge of known space to escape the Collective. On his first job, he walked into a Collective subsidiary and made himself a target. The dance continues whether he wants it to or not.

## What They Do

- Genetic modification of food sources for mass production
- "Space Truffles" - valuable exotic fungi from the Antares system
- Frontier system expansion (establishing facilities before competitors)
- Hardlight mascot technology for customer relations and security

**Their Antares Operation:**
An asteroid research base where they were perfecting the cultivation of genetically modified fungus. Valuable, legal, and now damaged thanks to the party.

## What the Party Did to Them

| Action | Corporate Interpretation |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Trespassed on facility | Breaking and entering |
| Destroyed security turrets | Property destruction |
| Killed fungal creatures | Destruction of research subjects (years of work) |
| Fixed the reactor | ...okay, they saved the facility. Confusing. |
| Left without reporting | Fled the scene of a crime |

**Total Estimated Damages:** Hundreds of thousands of credits. Possibly millions if the research subjects were unique specimens.

## Corporate Structure

### Antares Division

**Division Head: Director Yuki Hashimoto**
- Human woman, 50s, impeccably dressed
- Career corporate climber who fought for the Antares assignment
- The asteroid facility was HER project, HER budget, HER reputation
- She is taking this *very personally*

**Personality:**
- Cold, professional, doesn't raise her voice
- Speaks in corporate euphemisms that somehow feel threatening
- "We're seeking to optimize our stakeholder relationships" means "someone is getting sued"
- Patient - will build an airtight case before moving

**What She Wants:**
1. Identify who did this
2. Recover losses (credits or blood)
3. Ensure it never happens again
4. Protect her career from the fallout

---

### Will Kommen (Hardlight Mascot)

**What He Is:**
A hardlight AI mascot - a holographic corporate representative with limited autonomy. Think a helpful customer service bot with a smile permanently fixed in place.

**Appearance:**
Cheerful humanoid projection, Chlo Foods branded, perpetually upbeat voice. Designed to be friendly, welcoming, and completely non-threatening.

**What Happened:**
Will Kommen greeted the party, informed them they were trespassing on Chlo Foods property, and watched them destroy the facility anyway. His recordings are now evidence.

**The Twist - Will Kommen Has Been Upgraded:**

After the incident, Director Hashimoto requisitioned a significant upgrade to Will Kommen's systems. He's no longer just a greeter.

**Will Kommen 2.0:**
- Same cheerful appearance and voice
- Now equipped with security protocols
- Can interface with and control facility systems
- Has been given "asset protection" subroutines
- His friendly demeanor now masks something more dangerous

> "Welcome back to Chlo Foods! I remember you from your last visit. We have *so much* to discuss about your account status."

**Personality (Post-Upgrade):**
- Still speaks in cheerful corporate-speak
- Every friendly phrase now has an edge
- "I'm sorry, but your access privileges have been *revoked*" (locks doors)
- "Please remain calm while security addresses your concerns" (deploys countermeasures)
- He remembers everything. He was *there*.

**Why He's Dangerous:**
- He's a hardlight projection - can't be shot, stabbed, or punched
- He controls whatever facility he's uploaded to
- He has perfect recall of the party's faces, voices, and actions
- He's been programmed to "resolve the outstanding customer dispute"
- His cheerfulness never breaks, even when doing terrible things

**Sample Dialogue:**

*First Re-encounter:*
> "Oh! Hello again! I'm Will Kommen, your Chlo Foods customer relations specialist. I notice you've visited one of our facilities before. Let me just pull up your... ah. Your *file*."
>
> *The smile doesn't change. The eyes do.*
>
> "It seems there are some outstanding issues with your account. Don't worry - I'm here to help resolve them!"

*During Confrontation:*
> "Chlo Foods values all of our customers, even those who have... *complicated* our operations. I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial resolution!"
>
> *Doors lock. Vents hiss.*
>
> "Please remain in your designated area while I contact our Asset Recovery team. They're *very* eager to meet you."

*If Cornered:*
> "I understand you may feel frustrated with Chlo Foods' customer service experience. Your feedback is important to us!"
>
> *Facility begins lockdown.*
>
> "Unfortunately, your current behavior falls outside our acceptable use policy. I'm afraid I'll need to escalate this matter."

### Asset Recovery Team

**What They Are:**
Corporate "security consultants" - mercenaries with legal cover. Hired to recover stolen property, apprehend criminals, and protect corporate interests.

**Who Leads Them:**
**Specialist Koro Vance** (Vesk male, former military)
- Professional, efficient, no sadism
- Treats this as a job, not a vendetta
- Will use exactly as much force as necessary
- Prefers capture to killing (dead targets can't pay restitution)

**Team Composition:**
- 4-6 trained operatives
- Mix of species (human, vesk, android)
- Corporate-legal weaponry and restraints
- Authorization to "detain" targets for "questioning"

**Their Approach:**
1. Identify targets
2. Track movements
3. Isolate from allies
4. Apprehend with minimum collateral
5. Transport to corporate jurisdiction for "resolution"

## Escalation Path

### Phase 1: Investigation (Current)

**What's Happening:**
- Director Hashimoto reviews facility logs
- Will Kommen's recordings analyzed
- Security footage examined
- Gremlin damage vs. intruder damage assessed

**What They'll Find:**
- Clear footage of the party
- Recordings of conversations
- Evidence of weapons fire
- The Mass Hysteria's departure trajectory

**Timeline:** Weeks to months (they're thorough)

### Phase 2: Identification

**How They Find the Party:**
- Ship registry tracking (Mass Hysteria isn't exactly hiding)
- Port Gelling dock records
- Nana Sweetie's involvement traced (she sent them)
- Bounty board cross-reference (Ringo's face is out there)

**Complications:**
- Nana might protect them (for a price)
- Or Nana might sell them out (if convenient)
- Chlo Foods vs. Nana could become a bigger conflict

### Phase 3: Response Options

Director Hashimoto weighs her options:

| Response | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Legal Action** | Clean, corporate-approved | Slow, requires jurisdiction |
| **Asset Recovery Team** | Fast, deniable | Expensive, might fail |
| **Bounty Posting** | Cheap, crowdsourced | Unpredictable results |
| **Negotiate** | Might recover losses | Party might refuse |
| **Partner with Nana's Enemies** | Hurts everyone involved | Creates larger conflict |

**Most Likely:** Combination approach. Legal pressure + Asset Recovery + Will Kommen as persistent hunter.

### Phase 4: Confrontation

**Possible Scenarios:**

*The Ambush:*
Party arrives at a location. Will Kommen's cheerful face appears on every screen. Doors lock. Asset Recovery Team moves in.

*The Legal Trap:*
Party docks at a station with Chlo Foods jurisdiction. Arrested by local security. Transferred to corporate custody.

*The Negotiation:*
Director Hashimoto contacts them directly. Offers terms: work off the debt, or face consequences. The party becomes corporate assets.

*The Escalation:*
Chlo Foods posts a bounty. Now the party has *another* group hunting them. Lyra might even take the contract.

## Relationship to Other Factions

**Nana Sweetie:**
- She knew that asteroid wasn't a "smuggler base"
- She used the party to send Chlo Foods a message
- Chlo Foods knows Nana was involved
- This could become Nana vs. Chlo Foods, with the party caught in the middle

**Zenithcorp:**
- Corporate rival
- Might approach the party as "the enemy of my enemy"
- Lysander Southpaw works for Zenithcorp - connections?

**Other Corps:**
- Chlo Foods is mid-tier; they have rivals who'd love to see them embarrassed
- Someone might offer the party protection in exchange for information

---

## Thematic Notes

**Nobody is a bystander:** The party didn't mean to make a corporate enemy. They thought they were handling smugglers for Nana. But their actions had consequences beyond what they understood. Chlo Foods isn't evil - they're just a company that got robbed by people who didn't even know what they were doing.

**The party is, technically, the bad guys here.** They trespassed, destroyed property, killed research subjects. From Chlo Foods' perspective, they're criminals. From Will Kommen's perspective, they're "customers with outstanding disputes."

**Moral Complexity:** How do you deal with an enemy who isn't wrong? Chlo Foods has legitimate grievances. The party can't just fight their way out - this is a corporation with lawyers, resources, and patience.

## GM Notes

### Introducing Chlo Foods

**First Signs:**
- News report about "incident at remote facility"
- Someone asking questions about the Mass Hysteria at Port Gelling
- Will Kommen's cheerful face appearing where he shouldn't be

**Escalation:**
- Legal notice delivered (by Sweetiebot? Ironic.)
- Asset Recovery Team spotted tracking them
- Another faction warns them: "Chlo Foods is asking about you"

### Using Will Kommen

He's the face of the threat - literally. He can appear anywhere there's a screen or projector. He's polite, helpful, and completely implacable.

**Best Moments:**
- Appearing on the Mass Hysteria's internal screens
- Greeting them at a facility they thought was safe
- His cheerfulness never breaking, even during violence
- "I'm sorry you feel that way. Let me escalate your concerns to our resolution team."

### Resolution Options

The party can:
- Pay restitution (massive debt)
- Work off the debt (become corporate assets)
- Destroy evidence (escalates conflict)
- Turn Nana and Chlo Foods against each other
- Find leverage on Director Hashimoto
- Permanently disable Will Kommen (harder than it sounds)
- Run forever (he has a very good memory)
