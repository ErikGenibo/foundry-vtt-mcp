> "Your bounty says alive. It doesn't say intact."

## At a Glance

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Species** | Vesk |
| **Profession** | Bounty Hunter |
| **Target** | Jax Lionheart (#4 on Galaxy-Wide Top 5) |
| **Status** | Incoming - weeks to months away |
| **Method** | Digital tracking, direct confrontation |

---

## The Contrast

Where Lyra "Ghost" is subtle, psychological, and patient, Gaxxus is direct, physical, and efficient. He doesn't play games. He doesn't send messages. He tracks, he arrives, he breaks.

**Lyra's Approach:** Surveillance, mind games, waiting for the perfect moment
**Gaxxus's Approach:** Find target. Confront target. Take target.

Both are extremely good at their jobs. Gaxxus just prefers to do his job faster.

---

## Appearance

A Vesk bounty hunter built for intimidation:
- Massive frame, even for Vesk standards
- Scarred scales from decades of combat
- Military-grade cybernetic augmentations (visible)
- Carries weapons openly - not trying to blend in
- Moves with trained precision, not brutish swagger

He looks like what he is: a professional predator.

---

## The Name

"The Breaker" isn't metaphorical.

**What He Breaks:**
- Resistance
- Escape attempts
- Bones, when necessary
- Digital security, surprisingly often

The name started as a reputation for violence. It evolved. Gaxxus discovered he was good at breaking more than people - he could break encryption, break alliances, break careful plans.

---

## Method

### Tracking

Gaxxus uses digital tracking extensively:
- Data mining from public and private sources
- Network of informants across the galaxy
- Pattern analysis of target behavior
- Financial trail tracking (purchases, transactions)

He's not just muscle. He's muscle with excellent information.

### Confrontation

When Gaxxus finds his target:
1. Cuts off escape routes first
2. Makes presence known (no ambush - he wants them to see him coming)
3. Offers one chance to surrender peacefully
4. If declined, applies precisely calibrated violence
5. Delivers target alive (if possible) or dead (if necessary)

**Philosophy:** "A broken arm heals. A dead bounty pays less."

## Relationship to Ringo

Gaxxus has no personal vendetta. Jax Lionheart is #4 on the Galaxy-Wide Top 5. That's a significant payday. Gaxxus is a professional - he's after the money, not the man.

**What He Knows:**
- Official bounty file on Jax Lionheart
- Last known locations (increasingly outdated)
- Associates (from the file, not current)
- The disguise exists (suspects but hasn't confirmed)

**What He Doesn't Know:**
- Ringo's current location (yet)
- The Mass Hysteria
- Prismara, Tu'Sev, Posie
- Lyra is already watching (hunters don't share)

---

## Why He's Dangerous

### Physical Threat
- Vesk warrior training
- Decades of combat experience
- Cybernetic enhancements
- Will use exactly as much force as required (and no more)

### Information Threat
- Excellent at finding people who don't want to be found
- Will identify the Mass Hysteria's crew eventually
- Can trace financial transactions, ship registrations, dock records
- Patient enough to wait for the right data

### Psychological Threat
- Not scary like Lyra (no mind games)
- Scary like gravity - inevitable, impersonal, unstoppable
- When he shows up, there's no negotiation. Only surrender or fight.

## Arrival Timeline

**Current Status:** Not yet in the Antares system

**Estimated Arrival:** Weeks to months

**Variables:**
- How quickly does data about "Ringo Stryx" connect to "Jax Lionheart"?
- Does Lyra's presence accelerate or delay his arrival?
- Does the party's activity create traceable patterns?
- Does someone sell them out?

Gaxxus is coming. The question is when.

---

## The Lyra Factor

Gaxxus and Lyra both hunt #4 on the Galaxy-Wide Top 5. They're competitors - but Lyra is smarter.

**What Lyra Does:**

Lyra approaches Gaxxus and tells him exactly where Jax/Ringo is. No tricks, no hidden fees. Just: "He's in the Antares system. Port Gelling. Ship called Mass Hysteria."

Then she tells him the rest: "I've already informed Ringo that you're coming. He'll be ready for you. I believe he'll kill you - but he'll be a softer target afterward."

She says this to his face. Openly. Honestly.

**Why Gaxxus Takes the Bait:**

Because he's Gaxxus.

He knows it's a trap. He knows Lyra is using him. He knows she expects Ringo to win - or at least to be weakened by the fight. He knows all of this.

He doesn't care.

Gaxxus believes he can get the job done anyway. He's never failed to collect a bounty. He's not about to start now just because some android is playing games. Let her scheme. He'll break Ringo, collect the bounty, and prove her wrong.

**Lyra's Calculation:**

If Gaxxus wins: She was wrong about Ringo. Fine. She adjusts.

If Ringo wins: Ringo is injured, exhausted, maybe emotionally compromised. His crew is shaken. Perfect time for Lyra to make her move.

If they both die: Problem solved either way.

**The Irony:**

Gaxxus knows he's being used. His pride won't let him back down. That pride is exactly what Lyra counted on.

## Confrontation Scenarios

### The Direct Approach

Gaxxus locates the Mass Hysteria. He approaches openly, makes his presence known, and offers terms: surrender Jax Lionheart, or face consequences.

**The Challenge:** The crew might fight. Gaxxus is prepared for that - but four against one means taking damage, even if he wins.

### The Separation

Gaxxus waits until Ringo is separated from the crew. Isolate, confront, take. Clean and professional.

**The Challenge:** The crew starts looking for their captain. Timer starts.

### The Leverage Play

Gaxxus identifies someone Ringo cares about. Uses them as pressure. Not torture - just: "Come quietly, or I start breaking things you value."

**The Challenge:** This isn't Gaxxus's preferred method. He'll do it if necessary, but it feels unprofessional.

### The Port Authority Play

In some jurisdictions, Gaxxus can invoke legal authority. "This bounty is authorized under Pact Worlds law. Local enforcement is required to assist."

**The Challenge:** Antares system is new. Jurisdiction is murky. Nana controls Port Gelling. This probably won't work here.

## GM Notes

### Introducing Gaxxus

Don't rush him. Lyra is the current hunter threat. Gaxxus is the future one - mentioned, foreshadowed, but not yet present.

**Foreshadowing Options:**
- News report: "Notorious bounty hunter 'The Breaker' seen in [nearby system]"
- NPC mentions: "You hear Gaxxus is working the Top 5 these days"
- Data trace: Someone's been querying records about Mass Hysteria registrations

### Running the Confrontation

When Gaxxus arrives, it should feel like a gear change. Lyra is psychological pressure. Gaxxus is immediate physical danger.

**The One Chance:** Gaxxus always offers one chance to surrender. This is the party's moment to negotiate, flee, or prepare. If they refuse, combat happens.

**Combat Notes:**
- Gaxxus is a solo boss encounter
- He's tough but not invincible
- Escape is valid - he'll pursue, but escape is possible
- Killing him has consequences (other hunters may take notice)

### Resolution Options

**Surrender:** Ringo goes with Gaxxus. The crew decides whether to rescue him.

**Fight:** Combat. Gaxxus is dangerous but beatable. What happens next depends on outcome.

**Flee:** The party escapes. Gaxxus pursues. New cat-and-mouse dynamic.

**Negotiate:** Ringo offers something Gaxxus wants more than the bounty. What could that be?

**Third Party:** Nana, Lyra, or someone else intervenes. Gaxxus has to deal with complications.

## Sample Dialogue

**On Arrival:**
> "Jax Lionheart. I'm here to collect. You have one chance to come quietly."
>
> *Pause.*
>
> "That was your one chance."

**If Asked to Walk Away:**
> "I don't walk away. I don't negotiate. I don't accept bribes. You're #4 on the Galaxy-Wide Top 5. That means something to professionals."

**If Threatened:**
> "You can try. Many have. I'm still working."

**After Victory:**
> "Bounty says alive. You'll live. Walking is optional."

*He doesn't hate you. He doesn't even know you. You're just a number on a list.*
