## The History

Lysander Southpaw was Ringo's childhood nemesis. Not a rival - a nemesis. The distinction matters.

**Rivals:** Compete for the same goals. Push each other to be better. Might become friends under different circumstances.

**Nemeses:** Hate each other specifically. The conflict is personal, not circumstantial. Won't stop until one of them loses.

*The specific history between Ringo and Lysander hasn't been revealed yet. But it was bad enough that "childhood nemesis" is how Ringo remembers him.*

---

## Current Status

Lysander works for Zenithcorp - a major corporation with resources, reach, and reasons to be in the Antares system.

**Known Facts:**
- Employed by Zenithcorp
- Owns a ship called "Aura Zenith"
- Still exists, still active
- Presumably still hates Ringo

**Unknown:**
- Does he know where Ringo is?
- Is he actively looking?
- What does he want (beyond generic enmity)?
- What happened between them as children?

---

## Zenithcorp Connection

Zenithcorp is a corporate rival to companies like Chlo Foods. They're interested in the Antares system's resources and opportunities.

**What Lysander Has Access To:**
- Corporate intelligence networks
- Funding for "projects"
- Legal authority in some jurisdictions
- Ship, crew, equipment
- Plausible deniability

**What He Might Do:**
If Lysander discovers Ringo is in the Antares system, he could:
- Use Zenithcorp resources to track him
- Claim it's "corporate security" business
- Hire additional help (bounty hunters, mercenaries)
- Approach the party's enemies (Chlo Foods, the Collective)

---

## The Personal Element

Lyra is professional. Gaxxus is professional. The Cerulean Collective is professional.

Lysander is *personal*.

**Why This Matters:**
- He won't take a payoff
- He won't be satisfied with just the bounty
- He wants Ringo to suffer, not just get captured
- He might sabotage other hunters to ensure HE is the one who wins

**The Danger:** Personal enemies are unpredictable. They don't follow bounty hunter rules. They don't have clean extraction plans. They escalate.

---

## The Ship: Aura Zenith

Lysander owns a ship. Having your own ship as a corporate employee suggests either:
- High status within Zenithcorp
- Personal wealth
- Both

**Unknown:**
- Ship class and capabilities
- Crew composition
- Whether it's in the Antares system

## Potential Scenarios

### The Accidental Encounter

The party runs into Lysander without warning. Maybe at a port. Maybe during a job. Maybe Zenithcorp and Nana have overlapping interests.

**Ringo's Reaction:** This is the test. How does he respond to seeing someone from his past? Does he hide? Confront? Pretend not to notice?

### The Deliberate Hunt

Lysander discovers Ringo is in the Antares system and comes specifically to find him. Unlike the other hunters, he's not after the bounty - he's after revenge (or whatever the childhood conflict was about).

### The Corporate Angle

Zenithcorp interests align against the party. Lysander is assigned to deal with them - and discovers his childhood nemesis is involved. Now it's business AND personal.

### The Information Trade

Lysander has resources the party needs. Or the party has information Zenithcorp wants. Negotiation with someone who hates Ringo specifically.

---

## The Childhood Mystery

What happened between Ringo and Lysander?

**Possibilities:**
- Status conflict (family wealth/position differences)
- Romantic rivalry
- Betrayal (one sold out the other)
- Violence (someone got hurt)
- Identity (Lysander knows who Ringo really was)
- The Dance (something to do with Meyel's blessing)

*This should be revealed through play, not predetermined. Let the player's choices inform what happened.*

---

## Relationship to Other Hunters

### Lyra

Would Lysander work with an android bounty hunter? Probably not by choice - but if Lyra approaches him with useful information, he might listen.

### Gaxxus

Lysander and Gaxxus are likely to clash. Gaxxus is professional; Lysander is personal. Gaxxus wants the bounty; Lysander wants revenge. They could get in each other's way.

### The Collective

If Lysander is still connected to Pahtra society, he might know about the Cerulean Collective. Or he might BE connected to them somehow. This could complicate everything.

---

## GM Notes

### When to Introduce

Lysander is a "potential" threat, not an "active" one. Introduce him when:
- The party needs another complication
- Ringo's backstory is ready to be explored
- Zenithcorp becomes relevant to the plot
- The other hunters have run their course

**Don't:**
- Introduce him too early (Lyra and Gaxxus need their time)
- Make him a minor obstacle (he's personal, treat him as significant)
- Define the childhood conflict before Ringo's player has input

### The Personal Touch

Lysander's scenes should feel different from other antagonist encounters. This isn't business. It's history.

**Elements:**
- He knows things about Ringo that others don't
- He calls him "Jax" (or another name from childhood)
- He brings up specific memories
- He wants to see Ringo react emotionally

### Corporate Resources

Zenithcorp makes Lysander more dangerous than a solo operator. He has:
- Legal cover for actions
- Funding for equipment and personnel
- Access to information networks
- Backup when needed

**But also:**
- Corporate oversight (he can't go too far off-script)
- Accountability (his actions reflect on Zenithcorp)
- Priorities (sometimes Zenithcorp needs him elsewhere)

## Possible Revelations

As the conflict develops, consider revealing:

**About Lysander:**
- Why does he hate Ringo specifically?
- What did he lose because of their childhood conflict?
- Has he changed since then, or stayed the same person?

**About Ringo:**
- What did Ringo do as Jax that created this enemy?
- Was Ringo the victim, the aggressor, or both?
- Does he regret what happened?

**About the Dance:**
- Did Meyel's blessing affect their rivalry?
- Was Lysander blessed too? Or cursed by Ringo's blessing?
- Is there a divine element to their conflict?

## Sample Dialogue

**On Recognition:**
> "Hello, Jax. New fur. Same coward underneath."

**On the Past:**
> "You don't get to pretend it didn't happen. I remember. I remember everything."

**On the Hunt:**
> "The bounty's just a bonus. This was always going to end with us."

**If Given a Chance to Walk Away:**
> "Walk away? I've been walking toward this for years."

*Some enemies are made. Some enemies are grown. Lysander is both.*
