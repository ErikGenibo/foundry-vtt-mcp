## Pending Decisions

### The Specimen Jar
What do you do with preserved Newborn tissue?

| Option | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Keep it | Risk of it "planting" itself |
| Give to Nana | Accelerates her timeline |
| Give to Cog | Unknown experiments |
| Ask Midwife | May explain what it is |
| Destroy it? | Unknown if possible |

### Extracted Seeds (Future)
If the Midwife cures Jemini, she'll extract Seeds of Flesh. Party must decide:
- Let her take them (returned to Aucturn)
- Keep them (dangerous, tempting)
