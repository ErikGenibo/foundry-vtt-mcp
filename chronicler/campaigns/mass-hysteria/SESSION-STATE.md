## PREVIOUS TASK: Fleshing Out Session Prep

### COMPLETED THIS SESSION:
1. **Cave Combat Encounter** - Redesigned completely
   - Removed placeholder guards
   - Created "The Incomplete" (botched transformations from Bori's backlash)
   - Created "The Hollow" (Precursor defense system, disguised as bug-things)
   - Two factions fighting each other, party walks into ongoing war
   - Multiple resolution paths, moral complexity
   - Clue obfuscation built in (Precursor nature hidden)

2. **Nana Sweetie Full Profile** - Added to session prep
   - Human, 100+ years old, elderly Black woman in wheelchair
   - Elderly Machiavelli - kindly grandmother act is deliberate
   - "Nana doesn't slip" - everything she shows is intentional
   - Sweetiebot hierarchy documented (Greeter → Helper → Patrol → Protector → M.A.D.S.)
   - Sample dialogue for debrief scene
   - Previous interactions with party noted

3. **Midwife Quote Preserved** - "He was standing in front of an ocean and asking it to make him special."

### ALSO COMPLETED:
4. **Cure Ritual Experience** - Full 5-beat dramatic sequence
   - Consent mechanics and persuasion DCs
   - Beat-by-beat read-aloud (Search → Finding → Drawing Out → Loss → Completion)
   - Aftermath: Jemini's emotional state, extracted seeds decision, Cassie reunion

5. **Cassie's Hidden Knowledge** - Full section added
   - Recontextualized for <5 year timeline (Antares system newly opened)
   - Her husband Talven (Jemini's father) - disappeared chasing the truth
   - Knowledge of ruins, "channels," and what's under Port Gelling
   - Jemini never knew her father - this is new to her too

6. **Cultist Survivors** - 4 additional NPCs created
   - Davros (Shirren, true believer, has Seeds, ticking bomb)
   - Kellix (Ysoki, con artist, knows blackmail files)
   - Venn (Human, archivist, documented 73 transformations)
   - Zara (optional - completed cultist, looks normal, watching them)

7. **Guk Follow-Up Scene** - Full scene written
   - Ringo-focused, goblin debt culture
   - Services Guk can offer (information, scavenging, distraction, etc.)
   - Path to goblins becoming recurring allies or staying transactional
   - Sample dialogue for Guk

### TIMELINE FIX APPLIED:
- Port Gelling is <5 years old (Drift Beacon recently activated)
- Nana was HERE when the Beacon activated (mystery)
- Cassie is first-wave settler, not decades-long resident
- Talven disappeared ~4 years ago while Cassie was pregnant

---

## MAJOR LORE ESTABLISHED THIS SESSION

### The Precursors
- Ancient biotech civilization
- Grey goo apocalypse nearly destroyed them
- Solution: fragment nanites into single-purpose "personalities"
- Scattered across Antares system (each planet got different function)
- Sauriels-Garden: growth/connection → the lichen
- Unknown planet: travel/aid → Posie's friends
- Haunted Sif: unknown function → Mother Swarm

### Posie's Friends
- NOT Vesk-made - Precursor tech the Vesk found
- Received the Drift Signal, built a ship, went looking for "help"
- Don't understand WHY they were fragmented/trapped
- Posie is unknowingly carrying a potential grey goo restart

### The Newborn
- NOT evil - just Change incarnate
- Doesn't want anything - simply IS
- Where its presence touches, transformation happens
- Doesn't have human emotions - either impassive force or incomprehensible motives
- **Key quote:** "Bori thought he was communing with a god. He was standing in front of a river and asking it to make him special."
- The Newborn's presence may be CORRUPTING the Precursor containment system

### The Eggshell Fragment
- Not remnant of birth - remnant of PASSAGE
- The Newborn moved through this place once
- What remains is "afterbirth" - potent, sacred, dangerous

### Seeds of Flesh
- The "flesh burritos" / communion implants
- Being mass-produced by the Midwife AGAINST HER WILL
- Jemini has been exposed, slowly changing

---

## QUICK RESUME PROMPT

"We were doing session prep for Mass Hysteria (Starfinder 2e). Session prep file is at `campaigns/mass-hysteria/sessions/2026-01-18-prep.md`. We were also building out Port Gelling NPCs - still need Herman's shop details and confirmation on Happy Varmint Pharmaceuticals. Jim (human, pawnshop co-owner) is a memorial to my dad - nothing bad happens to him. Check SESSION-STATE.md for full context."
