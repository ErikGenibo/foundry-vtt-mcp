---

## CURRENT TASK: Port Gelling NPC Descriptions

### Completed NPCs (ready to use):

**Already in Foundry journals with full descriptions:**
- Foreman Scritt (Ysoki) - work crew head
- The Shield that Encompasses (Barathu swarm) - armor shop
- Katar (Vesk) - weapon shop "Kill"
- Doctor Bobo (Skittermander) - clinic
- Cog (unknown species, heavily cybernetic) - UPGRADE

### ALL NPCs COMPLETE

**Corrections applied:**
- ODDZ & ENDZ - Both male partners; Oddz is scavenger/physical worker, Endz is grounded negotiator
- Asimov/Cog debate flipped - Asimov argues for machine dignity, Cog dismisses them as replaceable metal
- Jim - Emphasized as essential; does most actual work while others bicker
- Herman - Large bald man with handlebar mustache, market stand (no shop name), sells squoxes unsuccessfully
- "Doctor" Fowl - Confirmed as Sarcesian running Happy Varmint Pharmaceuticals
- Fr3d - Glitched security robot with personality, locals love him

### IMPORTANT NOTE:
**Jim is a memorial to the user's father. Nothing bad happens to Jim. Ever.**

## MAJOR LORE ESTABLISHED THIS SESSION

### The Precursors
- Ancient biotech civilization
- Grey goo apocalypse nearly destroyed them
- Solution: fragment nanites into single-purpose "personalities"
- Scattered across Antares system (each planet got different function)
- Sauriels-Garden: growth/connection → the lichen
- Unknown planet: travel/aid → Posie's friends
- Haunted Sif: unknown function → Mother Swarm

### Posie's Friends
- NOT Vesk-made - Precursor tech the Vesk found
- Received the Drift Signal, built a ship, went looking for "help"
- Don't understand WHY they were fragmented/trapped
- Posie is unknowingly carrying a potential grey goo restart

### The Newborn
- NOT evil - just Change incarnate
- Doesn't want anything - simply IS
- Where its presence touches, transformation happens
- Doesn't have human emotions - either impassive force or incomprehensible motives
- **Key quote:** "Bori thought he was communing with a god. He was standing in front of a river and asking it to make him special."
- The Newborn's presence may be CORRUPTING the Precursor containment system

### The Eggshell Fragment
- Not remnant of birth - remnant of PASSAGE
- The Newborn moved through this place once
- What remains is "afterbirth" - potent, sacred, dangerous

### Seeds of Flesh
- The "flesh burritos" / communion implants
- Being mass-produced by the Midwife AGAINST HER WILL
- Jemini has been exposed, slowly changing

---

## CONNECTION INFO

- Solution: reload Foundry + /mcp reconnect in Claude Code

## QUICK RESUME PROMPT

"We were doing session prep for Mass Hysteria (Starfinder 2e). Session prep file is at `campaigns/mass-hysteria/sessions/2026-01-18-prep.md`. We were also building out Port Gelling NPCs - still need Herman's shop details and confirmation on Happy Varmint Pharmaceuticals. Jim (human, pawnshop co-owner) is a memorial to my dad - nothing bad happens to him. Check SESSION-STATE.md for full context."
