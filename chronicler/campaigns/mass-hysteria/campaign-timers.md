## URGENT TIMERS

### Jemini's Infection
**Status:** Stage 1 (as of Session 2026-01-18)
**Clock:** Ticking - needs cure before Stage 4

| Stage | Timeframe | Symptoms | Reversibility |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Stage 1** | Now - 48 hours | Subtle: dark veins, scratching, quiet | Easy (Midwife) |
| Stage 2 | 48-72 hours | Visible: fever, "hearing" something, pattern talk | Harder (Midwife + ritual) |
| Stage 3 | 72-96 hours | Shifting: flesh moves, lost time, whispers back | Significant effort |
| Stage 4 | Beyond | Transformation begins, becomes vector | May be too late |

**Current Location:** Nana's compound with Cassie
**Cure Path:** Rescue Midwife from cave → consent → ritual
**Next Step:** Party descending into cave

## ACTIVE TIMERS

### Lyra's Surveillance
**Status:** ACTIVE - Already watching
**Trigger:** Unknown (she found Ringo independently)
**Evidence:** "XOXO" message with surveillance photo

**What She's Doing:**
- Psychological pressure campaign
- Building complete picture of party
- Waiting for optimal strike opportunity

**Escalation Path:**
1. More messages, more proof of surveillance
2. Information leaks (reveal Ringo's identity to others)
3. Isolation attempts (separate Ringo from party)
4. Direct confrontation (when she has advantage)

**Party Awareness:** Know she exists, don't know when she'll strike

### Nana's Investigation
**Status:** TRIGGERED (Session 2026-01-18)
**Trigger:** Party revealed Midwife lead and Newborn source

**Timeline:**
| Phase | Timeframe | What Happens |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Immediate** | Now | Nana has intel, wants to "talk" with Midwife |
| Short-term | 1-2 weeks | Sends people to investigate ruins |
| Medium-term | 1-2 months | Enhanced niaqui enters drug supply |
| Long-term | 3+ months | Drug spreads, people start changing |

**Key Quote:** *"Which means the Midwife can also plant them. Properly."*

**Can This Be Stopped?**
- Party could interfere with Nana's investigation
- Could warn the Midwife not to cooperate
- Could destroy the source (consequences unknown)
- Could ally with Nana and try to control the operation

## CONSEQUENCE TIMERS

### Guk's Goblins
**Status:** RESOLVED - Dead (Session 2026-01-18)
**Trigger:** Ringo did not vouch

**Immediate Consequence:** 12 goblins dead including Guk

**Ongoing Consequences:**
- Goblin contacts in the system are cold
- *"Port Gelling people? You work with the grandmother-machine."*
- Potential survivor seeking revenge or help
- Lost: allies, information network, Ringo's reputation among goblins

## DORMANT TIMERS (Not Yet Triggered)

### Mira and the Cultists
**Trigger:** How party handles Mira when she approaches
**Status:** NOT YET TRIGGERED

If triggered:
- **Help her disappear:** Cultist network becomes potential contacts
- **Take her to Cassie:** Messy confrontation, affects Cassie's arc
- **Abandon her:** Other cultists see party as threat

3-4 other scared cultists hiding in Port Gelling.

---

### The Midwife's Fate
**Trigger:** What party does after rescuing her
**Status:** NOT YET TRIGGERED

Options:
- **Free her, let her tend fragment:** Alien ally, Change flows properly
- **Free her, she leaves:** Gratitude, possible future contact
- **Kill her:** One less aberration, fragment untended
- **Leave imprisoned:** Seeds production could resume

---

### The Specimen Jar
**Trigger:** What happens to the preserved Newborn tissue
**Status:** IN PARTY'S POSSESSION

This is a ticking bomb. Options:
- Give to Nana (accelerates her timeline)
- Give to Cog (obsessed with transformation)
- Ask the Midwife about it
- Keep it (danger of it "planting" itself)
- Destroy it? (unknown if possible)

| Hunter | Status | ETA |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **Lyra "Ghost"** | Active, watching | Anytime |

### Posie's Pull
- Destination: Haunted Sif
- The Mother Swarm calls
- Friends are getting more insistent

### The Newborn's Attention
- Prismara has been noticed
- *"...there you are... the one who hears..."*
- What happens when it focuses?
