## The Name

Contemplatives discard childhood names at adulthood, choosing new ones that reference favorite quotes, intellectual heroes, or scientific theorems. Tu'Sev chose "The Mind-Forged Code Chapter 2 Verse 7."

### The Mind-Forged Code, Chapter 2, Verse 7

> "The Mindforged Code Chapter 2 Verse 7 dictates the methodology for confronting the unknown. The limitations of isolated thought are a constraint, not a sanctuary. The most profound truths reside in the physical cosmos, guarded by circumstance and obfuscation. Therefore, when encountering a mystery of the ancient past or an unknown people, you must first access the Akashic channels, integrating the raw sensory data of the immediate present with the archival wisdom of the deepest Astral records. Do not fear the noise of action or the chaos of the hunt; rather, understand that adventure is merely applied research, and the greatest Lore is often found beyond the library walls. All truths are connected; seek the magic that reveals the hidden logic."

**Core Philosophy:** Adventure is merely applied research. The greatest Lore is found beyond library walls.
