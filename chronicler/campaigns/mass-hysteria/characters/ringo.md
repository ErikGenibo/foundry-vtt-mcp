## Core Theme: The Dance

Ringo was blessed by Meyel at birth - life was a dance led by the goddess. He followed her steps and succeeded at everything. When CC ordered him to kill a child, he stopped dancing. Now he questions everything.

**Key Quote (internal):** "Why did her steps lead me there - and why couldn't I just follow them anyway? Why am I being punished for not murdering a child?"

## Backstory Summary

### Early Life

- **Uncle Bohofan**: War hero, trained Ringo in firearms, like a second father (considering retiring to "Florida")
