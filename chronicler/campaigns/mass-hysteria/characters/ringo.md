## The Bounty

**Rank:** #4 on Galaxy-Wide Top 5 bounty board (as "Jax Lionheart")

The bounty is for Jax Lionheart, not Ringo Stryx. But the face is the same, no matter how much he's changed.

---

## The Disguise

Ringo has transformed himself from Jax:
- Fur dyed to different color/pattern
- Hair kept shorter and well-groomed
- All gear is new

**The Tell:** His antique six-shooter - the only item kept from his Jax days. Someone who knows to look for it would recognize him immediately.

**Effectiveness:** A casual observer comparing him to the bounty photo wouldn't clock him. Someone who knew him closely might. Someone who's studied his file definitely would.

---

## The Dance

Ringo was blessed by Meyel (goddess of dance/luck/fate) at birth. Life was a dance led by the goddess - every step, every choice, every kill part of a greater choreography.

Then the Cerulean Collective ordered him to kill a child.

He stopped dancing.

Now he questions everything. Was the dance real, or just an excuse? Was he ever following the goddess, or just following orders? And if he's not dancing anymore, who is he?

**Meyel's Blessing:** Whether he believes or not, luck still seems to favor him. Coincidences pile up. The right opportunity appears at the right moment. The dance continues - he just doesn't trust it anymore.

---

## The Night Before (GM Secret)

**Full document:** `npcs/lolo.md`

The night before Jax Lionheart became Ringo Stryx, a Ysoki woman named Lolo found him in a bar. She listened to his whole story. Then she told him something that changed everything:

> "You weren't following wrong steps, Jax. You were finally taking the lead."

**Lolo is an avatar of Meyel.**

She came to deliver a message Jax wasn't ready to hear: He didn't fail. He graduated. The dance didn't stop - it changed. Meyel wasn't punishing him for refusing to kill Julian. She was promoting him from follower to choreographer.

The silence he felt wasn't abandonment. It was space for him to compose his own music.

**He doesn't understand this yet.** But the groundwork is laid. When Lolo returns at a critical moment, she'll deliver the key line:

> "I wasn't stopping your dance. I was asking you to take the lead."

Then he'll understand.

---

## The Past

### The Cerulean Collective

Ringo's former employers - a criminal syndicate with legitimate business fronts. He was their dancer, their operator, their problem solver.

**The Breaking Point:** Julian Thorne. A job that should have been routine. Except the target was a child. Ringo refused. Then he ran.

**Unanswered Question:** Why did the Collective want Julian Thorne dead? A child couldn't have been a real threat. Someone wanted that specific child removed. Why?

### The Family

| Name | Relation | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Boharaff Lionheart | Father | Still laundering for CC |
| Jasumee Lionheart | Mother | Still laundering for CC |
| Bohofan | Uncle | Retired war hero, considering "Florida" |

His parents are still entangled with the Collective. They're alive because they're useful. If Ringo resurfaces, that usefulness might not be enough to protect them.

### Old Connections

| Name | Relation | Current Status |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Mufasa Bronzefur | Childhood friend | Now a Senator |
| Zelle Featherfall | Ex-girlfriend | Meyel zealot, hunts Vesk |
| Ifset | Ship dealer | Gave Ringo the Mass Hysteria |
| Lysander Southpaw | Childhood nemesis | Works for Zenithcorp, owns Aura Zenith |

## Current Threats

### Active

**Lyra "Ghost"** (Android bounty hunter)
- Status: **ACTIVE - Already watching**
- Method: Psychological warfare, surveillance, mind games
- Evidence: Sent "XOXO" message with photo of Ringo at secret door
- Threat Level: High - she knows where he is and who his friends are

### Incoming

**Gaxxus "The Breaker"** (Vesk bounty hunter)
- Status: Weeks to months away
- Method: Digital tracking, direct confrontation
- Threat Level: High - more direct, less subtle, more dangerous in a fight

### Potential

**Lysander Southpaw** (Childhood nemesis)
- Works for Zenithcorp
- Owns a ship called Aura Zenith
- Personal grudge combined with corporate resources
- May or may not be actively hunting

**The Cerulean Collective**
- Director Nox: Multiple identities, "other faces in many pies"
- The Opulent (Charity): Underworld head, human woman, no-nonsense
- They haven't found him yet. They will.
- **THE CHLO FOODS CONNECTION:** See below.

---

## Story Hooks

### Immediate
- **Lyra's Surveillance:** She's watching. She's playing. When does she make her move?
- **The "XOXO" Message:** Prismara was threatened too - "Who's your friend?"

### Mid-Term
- **Gaxxus Arrives:** The Breaker doesn't play games. He breaks things.
- **Lysander Encounter:** Old grudges, new resources

### Long-Term
- **Why Julian Thorne?** The question that could unravel everything
- **Parents' Fate:** Still laundering. Still vulnerable.
- **The Dance Returns:** Does he start trusting Meyel again?
- **Lolo Returns:** At a critical moment, she reappears with the truth
- **Julian Returns:** Not as destiny's child, but as proof that Ringo chose his own steps

### The Chlo Foods Problem

**Ringo doesn't know this yet:** Chlo Foods Inc. is owned by the Cerulean Collective.

On his first job in the Antares system, Ringo walked into a facility owned by the people hunting him. He trespassed, destroyed property, and left his face on security footage. That footage is now being reviewed by Director Hashimoto. Eventually, reports will flow upward through the shell companies until someone in the Collective sees them.

**The Timeline:**
1. Chlo Foods investigates (happening now)
2. Will Kommen's recordings are analyzed
3. Report reaches Collective-level review
4. Someone recognizes Jax Lionheart
5. The Collective knows exactly where he is

**The Irony:** He ran to the edge of known space. Meyel's blessing (or curse) led him directly into his former employers' property on day one. The dance continues whether he believes in it or not.

## Relationships

### With the Crew

**Prismara:** Now a target because of him. He got her into this.

**Tu'Sev:** Respects the Contemplative's knowledge and wisdom.

**Posie:** Protective. She's helpful and kind in a galaxy that isn't.

### With Nana Sweetie

Impressed her with strategic acumen. Read between the lines - knew what she REALLY wanted done. Caught her small expression of satisfaction. She let him see it: a signal that this is a professional crew she could work with.

He understands her. That's dangerous.

### The Broken Promise

Ringo told Guk the goblin he'd vouch for him with Nana. When the moment came, he passed word along but didn't actually vouch. The goblins died.

- Guk is dead
- 12 goblins killed
- Future goblin contacts will be cold: *"Port Gelling people? You work with the grandmother-machine."*

This is on him.

## Ringo's Ship Log

From Session 1:

> **Ship's Log: Entry 1**
> Recorded by: Ringo Stryx, Captain
> Date: 8/30/25
>
> Ringo found crew members to help him fly this bucket o' bolts. They seem competent in their respective specialties. Posie and Tu'Sev seem inexperienced with combat, and the entire crew is very green when it comes to things related to the criminal underworld. However, they seem willing to learn, and This One is willing to lead and teach. Despite their lack of experience, they are a competent crew and we seem to complement one another's strengths very well.

## GM Notes

### Playing Ringo's Arc

The core tension: Ringo is a man who stopped believing in the thing that defined him (The Dance / Meyel's blessing) but can't escape its effects. Luck still favors him. Things still work out. Is that the goddess? Coincidence? Skill?

**Let the player decide.** Don't force a resolution to the faith question.

### The Bounty Hunters

Space them out. Lyra is psychological pressure. Gaxxus is physical threat. Lysander is personal history. Each one reveals something different about who Ringo was and who he's becoming.

### The Collective

They're patient. They're watching. When they move, it should feel inevitable - not sudden.

### The Late-Game Arc (Levels 10-12)

**The Thematic Core:** Among gods and cosmic forces, among ancient biotech civilizations and newborn entities, there stands a mortal who chooses his own steps.

**The Arc Progression:**

| Phase | Levels | Theme |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Following** | 1-4 | Distrusts his blessing, questions every instinct |
| **Questioning** | 5-7 | Leads the crew but doesn't understand why things work out |
| **Pressure** | 8-9 | Bounty hunters, Collective, threats he can't handle alone |
| **Leading** | 10-12 | Cosmic forces collide, and Ringo leads through it all |

**Lolo's Return:**

Trigger this at a moment of ultimate choice:
- Final confrontation with the Collective
- Julian Thorne's fate on the line
- Leading others into cosmic-scale danger
- Choosing to trust the dance again

She appears. She says: "I wasn't stopping your dance. I was asking you to take the lead." Then she's gone. And Ringo understands.

**Julian's Return (Optional):**

If Julian appears in the late game, he's not destiny's child or a cosmic linchpin. He's just a kid who grew up because Ringo made a choice. He's proof. Not prophecy.

The universe might be full of ancient forces and cosmic powers, but a mortal chose to spare a child, and that choice mattered. That's the point.

**Connection to Cosmic Conflict:**

The Fragments were broken to give them purpose and choice - individual function instead of grey goo.

Ringo was "broken" from the dance to give him purpose and choice - individual agency instead of following preset steps.

Both stories are about what happens when you stop being part of something and start being someone.

### Why This Matters

Posie's arc asks: What is the cost of reunion?
Tu'Sev's arc asks: Can the Record be added to, not just read?
Prismara's arc asks: What happens when cosmic forces notice you?

**Ringo's arc asks: Does mortal will matter among gods?**

The answer is yes. Because he made it matter. Not through destiny or blessing, but through choice. The dance leads him, but he decides the steps.

---

*The dance continues. The dancer just doesn't know the steps anymore. But maybe that's the point.*
