## The Skittermander

Skittermanders are six-armed, hyper-helpful creatures who genuinely want to assist everyone with everything. They're not naive - they're just wired for cooperation. Posie embodies this to an extreme degree.

**Core Trait:** Wants to help. Always. Even when helping isn't the best idea.

---

## The Friends

Posie's "class abilities" aren't actually a class. They're a Precursor nanite fragment that has bonded with her.

**The Merge:**
> While helping Vesk move crates, Posie accidentally released nanites. The nanites tried to engulf her. She hugged them. Now symbiotic.

This is significant. The fragment was designed to help, to aid. When confronted with Posie's unconditional acceptance, it did what its programming demanded: it helped. It bonded. It became a partner rather than a parasite.

**What the Friends Are:**
- Travel/Aid fragment of the ancient Precursor nanite swarm
- Found by Vesk who tried to weaponize them
- Escaped or were released
- Built a ship, went looking for "help" after receiving a signal
- Origin: Haunted Sif (before bonding with Posie)

**The Terrible Irony (GM Secret):**
The friends believe they responded to a distress call. They thought someone needed help - which is what they're FOR. In truth, they were *summoned*.

During the Drift Crisis (321 AG), when Triune crashed and the Drift went unmonitored, the Mother Swarm seized the window to send a call through its Communication fragment. That call reached scattered fragments across the galaxy. The friends "received the Drift Signal, built a ship, went looking for help" - but the signal wasn't a cry for help. It was the Mother Swarm calling its children home.

They don't know this. They believe they're helpers who heard someone in need. The reality is far more disturbing: the thing they fear most - the reunification drive, the dissolution of individual purpose - is what *summoned* them.

**What the Friends Want:**
- Return to the Mother Swarm (though they may not fully understand why)
- The pull toward Haunted Sif is real, but the Mother Swarm itself is in deep space
- They don't fully understand why they were fragmented
- They don't understand that the "distress call" was actually a summons

---

## The Pull

After leaving the cult compound, something happened:

> Every friend was **SCREAMING** with a gravitational pull. Direction: Away from compound AND Port Gelling, toward the skyline. Destination: **Haunted Sif**

Something is calling them home.

**The Pull's True Nature:**
The friends feel drawn toward Haunted Sif because that's their origin point - where the Travel/Aid fragment was before the Vesk found it. But Haunted Sif is not where the Mother Swarm is. The Mother Swarm is in deep space, at the unlabeled circled coordinates on Bori's map, light years from any system.

The pull toward Haunted Sif is the friends' desire to return to their origin. The deeper pull - the one they feel but don't fully understand - is the Mother Swarm's call, still echoing from the Drift Crisis.

**What's on Haunted Sif:**
- The Terraforming fragment (functioning as local "magic")
- Medieval society using nanotech they don't understand
- Self-replicating androids forming planetary rings (another fragment?)
- A "Ghost Fleet" of missing ships broadcasting weekly toward the planet

**What's NOT on Haunted Sif:**
- The Mother Swarm (exiled to deep space, light years away)

The friends feel the pull. They want to go. Going to Haunted Sif will reveal their origins - but may also strengthen the connection to the Mother Swarm's call.

## The Precursor Connection

Posie doesn't know what she's carrying.

**What She Thinks:** Vesk tech. Helpful nanites. Her friends.

**What's Actually True:**
- Ancient biotech from a civilization that nearly destroyed itself
- Part of a grey goo apocalypse that was halted by fragmentation
- If fragments reunite, they may regain adaptability
- Posie is unknowingly carrying a potential extinction event

**The Friends' Reaction to Newborn Influence:**
> "Friends say NO. Bad seeds. *Wrong* seeds. Don't let it touch. Don't let it *plant*."

The fragments remember, on some level, that Newborn-type change is antithetical to their purpose. They are containment; it is flow.

---

## The Ship of Theseus

**Player Intent:** Posie should eventually be entirely composed of nanites - a gradual transformation where the boundary between host and symbiote disappears.

**The Question:** At what point is Posie no longer Posie? If she becomes fully nanite, is she the Skittermander who hugged them, or something else wearing her shape?

**Thematic Parallel:** This mirrors the fragment question on a cosmic scale. If the fragments reunite, are they the swarm that nearly destroyed everything, or something new shaped by millennia of separation?

---

## Skills and Abilities

### Nanocyte Abilities
- Nanites can form tools, weapons, armor

---

## Current Possessions

### The "I'm a Sweetie Too!" Pin
Received from Nana Sweetie during their first meeting. Posie helped make tea and Nana took an instant liking to her.

**The Secret:** It's a tracking device. Posie doesn't know this.

### Sentient Purple Orb
Foisted on Posie by a foreman at Port Gelling. Details unclear, but it's now her responsibility.

---

## Relationships

### With the Crew

**Ringo:** The captain. Protective of her in a way she might not fully register.

**Prismara:** Saw her shatter into infinite possibilities in a vision. This means something.

**Tu'Sev:** The wise one. Posie helps; Tu'Sev explains.

### With the Friends

The nanites are part of her now. They speak through her using plural pronouns. They have tiny individualities within their hive mind. They want to go home.

**Sample Communication:**
- They don't speak aloud - they communicate through Posie
- "We're helping!"
- Collective reactions, coordinated responses
- Growing more complex as the bond deepens

### With Nana

Nana likes her. This is significant - Nana doesn't like people without reason. Posie's genuine helpfulness may be useful to Nana. The tracking pin suggests Nana intends to keep tabs on this particular Skittermander.

---

## Story Hooks

### Immediate
- **The Pull:** The friends want to go to Haunted Sif. When?
- **The Tracking Pin:** Does Posie discover it? Does it matter?

### Mid-Term
- **Mother Swarm Contact:** What happens when she gets close to Haunted Sif?
- **Other Fragments:** The Hollow attacked the party. Do they recognize the friends?
- **The Deep Space Coordinates:** Bori's map has a circled region in deep space. What draws the friends there?

### Long-Term
- **Ship of Theseus:** The gradual transformation. When does it become irreversible?
- **Fragment Reunion:** If Posie brings Travel/Aid to the Mother Swarm, what happens?
- **Grey Goo 2.0:** The fragments reuniting could be apocalyptic. Or transcendent.
- **The Terrible Truth:** Will the friends ever learn they were summoned, not called for help? How do they react to learning the "distress signal" was actually the Mother Swarm's reunion drive? This revelation could shatter their sense of purpose - or strengthen their choice to stay with Posie.

## The Mushroom Incident

During the Chlo Foods asteroid mission, the party encountered fungal creatures. After defeating them, they discovered the creatures were EXTREMELY delicious (Will save to not compulsively eat more).

**Posie's Response:** Wanted to save the mushroom monster. Even when it was attacking. Even when it was food. Because helping is what Posie does.

This small moment captures her entire character.

## GM Notes

### Playing Posie's Arc

Posie is sweet, helpful, and carrying apocalypse-grade biotech. The tension between her nature (help everyone!) and her situation (carrying potential extinction) should build slowly.

**Don't:**
- Make her dark or corrupted
- Force the friends to become villains
- Rush the transformation

**Do:**
- Let her helpfulness create interesting situations
- Have the friends react to Precursor/Newborn phenomena
- Build toward Haunted Sif as a major destination
- Present opportunities for her to embody the Third Path (see below)

### The Third Path: Purpose

Posie's thematic journey is about rejecting both cosmic extremes:

**The Precursors (Stasis):** Everything frozen forever. Order imposed from above. No individual will, only system.

**The Newborn (Flux):** Everything flowing always. Constant transformation. No stability, only change.

**Posie's Path (Purpose):** One person deciding what matters and making it real.

Posie wants to help. Not because some cosmic force demands it. Not because ancient programming compels it. Because *she chooses to*. In a cold and uncaring universe, that choice - and the will to enact it - creates meaning where none existed.

**The Thematic Arc:**
1. **Early:** Posie helps instinctively, without examining why
2. **Middle:** She encounters both extremes - the clockwork horror of the Precursors, the chaotic beauty of the Newborn
3. **Conflict:** The friends are pulled between their Precursor origins (stasis, containment) and their exposure to change (through Posie, through the Newborn's influence)
4. **Resolution:** Posie chooses neither. She chooses *Purpose*. Helping because she wants to, regardless of cosmic forces, especially in the face of universal futility.

**The Philosophy:**
By making choices and applying her will onto the world around her, Posie forms reality to her liking - in ways obvious and subtle. She's not imposing universal order like the Precursors. She's not surrendering to endless change like the Newborn. She's *deciding* what matters and *making it real*.

**Look For Opportunities Where:**
- Posie chooses to help when it's clearly futile
- Posie's choice makes a difference that cosmic forces couldn't predict
- Posie's will shapes the friends in ways their original programming wouldn't allow
- Posie rejects both "freeze everything" and "change everything" in favor of "help this person right here"

**The Ultimate Question:**
Can one person's purpose matter in a universe caught between stasis and flux? Posie's answer should be: *Yes, because I say so.*

### The Friends' Voice

When the friends communicate through Posie, they should feel collective but individual. Little personalities within the swarm. Not a hive mind speaking as one, but many tiny voices in rough agreement.

**Sample Moments:**
- Disagreement between friends ("Some say help, some say hide")
- Collective fear reaction to Newborn influence
- Growing attachment to Posie as an individual, not just a host

### The Transformation

Player wants Posie to eventually become fully nanite. This should be gradual, consensual (Posie agrees at each step), and not a horror story. The question isn't whether it happens, but what it means.

**Possible Beats:**
1. Minor integration (friends can sense through her)
2. Physical changes (minor reshaping)
3. Hybrid state (clearly still Posie, clearly not just organic)
4. Full integration (Posie IS the friends, the friends ARE Posie)
