> **Player:** stitchymallows (Rebecca)

## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Species** | Skittermander |
| **Class** | Nanocyte (Absorption Faculty) |

| **Age** | ~8 years old (mature - Skittermanders mature at 6) |
| **Homeworld** | Vesk-3 (called Oeddertchonk by Skittermanders) |

## Appearance

- Six-armed fluffy creature
- Infused with nanite swarm ("friends")
- Think: **Stitch from Lilo & Stitch meets Big Hero 6 microbots**

## Core Concept

A helpful Skittermander who accidentally bonded with a Vesk weapon experiment (nanite swarm). Now she helps her "friends" find their way home to the Mother Swarm.

## Background

### Home Life
- Grew up in Skittermander community being paved over by expanding Vesk city
- Did odd jobs: construction, rubble clearing, warehouse work
- Very fulfilled at home, no grand plans
- Wanted to add whelps to the family, stay and keep community close-knit
- Some friends went offworld (bittersweet but proud of them)

### The Merge

While helping Vesk move crates:
1. Accidentally bumped satellite antenna
2. Sent helmet flying into a floating capsule
3. Tried to clean up the "slimy, glassy mess"
4. The nanite mass tried to engulf and conquer her
5. **She hugged it**
6. The nanites responded: *"friend"* ... *"help"* ... *"home?"*
7. Now symbiotic - Posie and her "friends" are one

### The Vesk
- Were researching the nanites as a weapon
- It kept eating their soldiers (told it would create super soldiers)
- Assume the nanites "ate" the Skittermander and are now loose
- May have notified her family she had "an accident"
- Family knows she went to "take some friends home"

### Joining the Crew
- Stowed away in a crate on the Mass Hysteria
- Found by Ringo next to already-assembled machinery (the crate held parts for it)
- First "crew member" Ringo added
- Immediately made the ship more homey

## Personality

- **Hearthkeeper** - community and family (found or otherwise) are everything
- Hangs pictures, gives handmade gifts (if space has yarn, crew has hats and scarves)
- Buys crew members' favorite drinks
- Decorates based on crew preferences, not her own
- Ensured all fire suppression systems are up to code (Safety Officer!)

## The Friends (Nanite Colony)

- Each nanite has a *tiny* bit of individuality within the hive mind
- Posie tries to get to know all of them
- If asked for a name, she'll list an intergalactic naming compendium until stopped
- Generally refers to them as "friends" (like she would people)
- Most of the time they sound like white noise/crowd chatter
- Occasionally go quiet or give feelings

### What the Friends Want
**To go home to the Mother Swarm**

Posie's vision: A planet made of nanites masking itself as a regular planet.

### The Pull

While shuttling back from Children of the Unseen Horizon compound:
- Friends went oddly silent, almost melancholy
- One gave a feeling - like gravity, a pull
- Then another joined, then another
- Until every friend was **SCREAMING** with this pull
- Then it ended suddenly
- Direction: Away from compound AND Port Gelling, toward the skyline
- Two possible destinations: **Kasadya VII** or **Haunted Sif**

## Destination: Haunted Sif

**This is where Posie's friends want to go.**

Evidence on Haunted Sif:
- Strange rings: Self-replicating 'dancing' androids spewing water vapor
- Medieval society with "sorcerers" who manipulate **ancient terraformer nanobots**
- The Mother Swarm is likely the source of this nanobot technology

## Future Arc (Player Desire)

Posie getting "Ship of Theseus'd" over time - eventually entirely composed of nanites. This is a problem to deal with later.

## Plot Hooks

- The pull toward Haunted Sif / Mother Swarm
- Sentient purple orb foisted on her by Port Gelling foreman
- Potential encounters: Proog (empathnid), Sapient purple orb, Ferrofluid ooze
- The mushroom monster (she wanted to save it, not kill it)

## Recent Events

### Mushroom Monster Compassion
Posie asked if there was a way to save the bio-engineered mushroom monster instead of killing it. Suggested:
- It went murderous due to bad husbandry (like Tilikum)
- Maybe Nana Sweetie could farm them ethically
- The fungal network could interface with her friends

### The Pull (Post-Cult Compound)
Experienced the gravitational pull from her friends. Charted possible destinations. Wants to keep searching for the source.
