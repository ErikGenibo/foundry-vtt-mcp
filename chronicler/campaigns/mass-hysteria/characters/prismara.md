## The Prismeni Gift

Prismara is Prismeni Vlaka - born blind, but gifted with precognitive abilities. She doesn't see the present. She sees what *will* happen.

**How It Works:**
- Navigates through future-sight, not current sight
- "Sees" obstacles by seeing herself avoid them
- Pilots through precognition - knows where things will be
- This isn't perfect - surprises happen, predictions fail

**The Limitation:** She sees *probabilities*, not certainties. The further ahead, the hazier it gets. And some futures refuse to be seen clearly.

---

## Thread-Sight (Session Discovery)

During the compound encounter, Prismara observed Jemini (one of the cultists) and saw something new:

**What She Saw:**
- Normal threads of fate/connection were *severed*
- New dark threads grew *downward*, connecting to something below
- The Seeds don't isolate people - they *rewire* them
- They're being plugged into a different network

**The Implication:**
Prismara can now perceive the Newborn's influence directly. The Seeds of Change don't just transform - they disconnect people from normal reality and connect them to... something else. The Newborn's network.

**How This Relates to the Connection Fragment:**
The lichen (Growth/Connection fragment) networks biological systems. The Newborn's Seeds hijack that networking ability. When Bori enhanced niaqui with Newborn flesh, he created a drug that uses Precursor networking technology as a vector for Newborn influence.

Prismara saw the result: people being disconnected from their normal connections and wired into something dark and downward.

**The Prismeni Connection:**
Thread-sight is an extension of Prismara's Prismeni heritage, not a separate ability. Prismeni see the future - probability threads, what *will* happen. Thread-sight is seeing those same threads in the present: the connections between people, the web of fate and relationship that binds reality together.

The death visions that haunt her may have opened this door. Seeing her own death means seeing the threads that lead there - and once you start seeing threads, you see them everywhere. The severed connections on Jemini, the dark threads growing downward... these are visible to her because she's already learned to perceive fate's architecture.

This means her growing abilities are all of a piece: precognition, thread-sight, and the death visions are facets of the same Prismeni gift. The question isn't where the power comes from - it's how far it will develop, and what she'll see next.

## Sensory Distortion (Session Discovery)

**During the compound/cave encounters, Prismara experienced something new:**

Her Vlaka senses - echolocation, scent, the way she navigates reality - started *lying* to her:
- Walls that felt like they went on forever when she touched them
- Rooms that her senses insisted were infinite
- Air that felt *thick* near the Incomplete

**What This Means:**

Prismara navigates through a combination of Vlaka blindsense (echolocation, scent) and Prismeni precognition (seeing what will happen). Both require reality to behave consistently. Her echolocation assumes sound bounces predictably. Her precognition assumes cause leads to effect.

**The Newborn's presence warps both.**

The Incomplete are beings mid-transformation - reality around them is *in flux*. They exist in a state of becoming, not being. Prismara's senses can't lock onto something that hasn't finished deciding what it is.

**The Thick Air:**
The air isn't actually thick. Prismara is sensing the *density of possibility* around the Incomplete. Her Prismeni gift perceives probability threads - near the Incomplete, those threads are tangled, knotted, fraying in all directions. It feels like moving through molasses because she's navigating through chaos, not order.

**The Infinite Walls:**
Her echolocation expects echoes to return. Near Newborn influence, space itself becomes uncertain. The walls don't go on forever - but they *might*, in some probability thread. Her senses are picking up all the possibilities at once instead of filtering for the most likely.

**The Implication:**
This is the first sign that Prismara's gift isn't just expanding - it's becoming *sensitive* to Newborn influence in a way that overwhelms her normal senses. She's not just seeing threads; she's drowning in them near sources of Change.

**GM Note:** This is an early symptom of what happens when thread-sight encounters unfiltered Newborn presence. The Incomplete are people in transformation - probability storms. The Midwife, by contrast, is a *completed* transformation - Prismara should perceive her as eerily stable, every thread precisely where it should be.

## The Visions

Prismara is fleeing something. Not just figuratively - literally. She has seen her own death.

**What She's Seen:**
- Glimpses of how she dies
- Enough detail to terrify, not enough to prevent
- Each vision slightly different - the future isn't fixed
- Running seems to delay it. Staying still seems to invite it.

**The Question:** Is she running toward safety, or just running?

---

## Background

**Academy Training:** Lajok Academy of Electro-Mechanical Sciences
- Scholarship student (merit, not privilege)
- PDF service history
- First voyage truly on her own

**This Voyage:** Before joining the Mass Hysteria, Prismara had never been truly independent. Academy, PDF, structured life. Now she's in the Antares system, on a ship with strangers, with death visions she can't shake.

## Current Threats

### Lyra's Message

The "XOXO" message wasn't just for Ringo. It included a postscript:

> "P.S.: Who's your friend? Maybe I should get to know them too"

Prismara is now a target. Not because of who she is - because of who she's with.

**The Photo:** Shows her keeping lookout while Ringo examined the secret door. She was doing her job. Now she's on a bounty hunter's radar.

---

## The Bori Connection

**A Dark Mirror:** Bori Novoi was also Vlaka. He pretended to be blind and deaf. Prismara actually is blind.

Both use their heritage as a mask - Bori to hide his true nature, Prismara to... what? She hasn't confronted this parallel yet.

**Bori's Research:** Among his possessions was research on Prismeni abilities. Why was a cult leader studying her people's gifts?

---

## The Newborn's Attention (FUTURE EVENT)

**This hasn't happened yet.** It will occur after the party meets the Midwife and interacts with the Newborn fragment.

**The Vision (When It Happens):**

> - Sensory, not visual (she's blind)
> - An "ocean" that felt wrong (grey goo, viscosity off)
> - Flashes of planets across the system
> - Posie charging and SHATTERING into infinite possibilities
> - Floating before a COLOSSAL EYE - the Newborn
> - The pupil focuses for the first time ever
> - On HER
> - Snap back

### The Moment of Focus (Read Aloud)

> You hear it before you understand it. A sound like tectonic plates grinding against each other, but slower. More deliberate. The creak of something that has never moved before learning how.
>
> The pressure changes. Not air pressure—something deeper. The weight of attention turning, the way you might feel someone's gaze in a dark room, but magnified beyond comprehension.
>
> A wet sound, impossibly vast. Fluid displacement on a scale that defies reason. You feel the vibration in your bones, in your teeth, in the spaces between your thoughts.
>
> Then: contraction. A tightening that you experience as subsonic rumble, as the sensation of falling without moving, as every hair on your body standing at attention.
>
> The pupil dilates.
>
> You don't see it—you *feel* it. The aperture widening like a door opening onto void. The sound is almost organic: a deep, resonant thrum that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere.
>
> And then it stops.
>
> Everything stops.
>
> The silence is worse than the sound. In that silence, you understand: you have been *noticed*.
>
> The eye of a being beyond imagining, a being that has never shown any sign of awareness for anything around it, has come into focus. And it is staring directly at you.

**The Implication:** The Newborn will notice her. A cosmic force of change that doesn't normally *notice* anything will turn its attention to a blind Vlaka mechanic.

This may mean nothing. This may mean everything.

**Trigger:** Interaction with the Newborn fragment in the cave, after meeting the Midwife.

## Relationships

### With the Crew

**Ringo:** Brought her into danger. The "XOXO" message proves it. But also gave her purpose - a ship, a crew, a reason to keep moving.

**Tu'Sev:** Fellow seekers of knowledge, different methods.

**Posie:** The vision of Posie shattering into infinite possibilities haunts her. What does it mean?

### With the Ship

The Mass Hysteria needs an engineer. Prismara is good at her job. The ship's quirks (5 life signs, sounds in the walls) intrigue rather than alarm her.

---

## Story Hooks

### The Death Visions
- What exactly does she see?
- Can it be prevented?
- Is running helping or just delaying?

### Thread-Sight
- What else can she perceive with this expanding ability?
- Can she see the Precursor fragments' connections?
- What happens when she looks at Posie and her friends?
- How far will her Prismeni gift develop? What's the ceiling?
- Did the death visions unlock this, or was it always latent?

### Sensory Distortion
- The hallucinations near the Incomplete - can she learn to filter them?
- What does the Midwife "look" like to her senses? (Stable, completed, every thread precise)
- If proximity to transformation causes sensory chaos, what happens near the Newborn itself?
- Can she use this as a detection method? (Distortion = Newborn influence nearby)

### The Newborn's Eye (Future)
- Triggered by: Interacting with Newborn fragment after meeting Midwife
- Why will it notice her? Does her ability to see threads make her visible to something that IS threads?
- What does its attention mean?
- Will it look again?

### Bori's Research
- What was he studying about Prismeni abilities?
- Did he know something about precognition?
- Connection to the Newborn's attention?

### Lyra's Threat
- Now a target alongside Ringo
- Her precognition might see the hunter coming
- Or it might not - Lyra is very good

## GM Notes

### Playing Prismara's Blindness

Don't let it be a limitation or a superpower. It's just how she exists. She navigates differently, perceives differently, but functions fully.

**Do:**
- Describe scenes in terms she'd perceive (sounds, textures, precognitive flashes)
- Let her precognition catch things others miss
- Have her miss things that require current-moment sight

**Don't:**
- Treat it as a disability to overcome
- Let precognition replace all other senses
- Forget that she has limits

### The Death Visions

These should be background radiation, not constant crisis. She's learned to live with them. They inform her choices but don't paralyze her.

**Escalation Path:**
1. Occasional hints - she avoids a situation, player knows why
2. Direct vision - something specific is coming
3. Confrontation - the vision becomes imminent

### The Newborn's Attention

This is a seed. Don't force it to grow too fast. The Newborn noticed her. What that means can develop over many sessions.

### Why the Newborn Notices Her

**The Core Concept:**
The Newborn IS connection. It exists as the network itself - the Drift may be its nervous system, the Seeds rewire people into its web. It doesn't normally *look* at things because it doesn't need to. It experiences reality through its connections, not through focused attention.

But Prismara can *see* those connections. Thread-sight means she perceives the architecture of fate, the web binding reality together. She's looking at the Newborn's body from the outside.

**That's why it notices her.**

When you perceive threads, you're not passively receiving information - you're *interfacing* with the same substrate the Newborn exists in. If the Newborn is the ocean, most people are fish swimming through it unaware. Prismara is a fish that can suddenly perceive water. And the ocean notices when something becomes aware of it.

**The Two-Way Street:**
Thread-sight isn't just observation - it creates a connection back. When Prismara looks at the Newborn's threads, she creates a thread *to* the Newborn. The more she uses this ability, the more visible she becomes.

**Escalation Path:**
1. **First Notice:** The Moment of Focus - it sees her, then looks away. Curiosity, not intent.
2. **Growing Awareness:** As she uses thread-sight more, it notices more often. Brief glances. The sense of being watched.
3. **Active Interest:** The Newborn starts *studying* her. Not hostility - curiosity. What is this small thing that can see me?
4. **Connection:** Unknown. Does it want to communicate? Consume? Understand? Transform?

**The Death Visions Connection:**
What if her death visions are entangled with the Newborn? She sees the threads leading to her death. What if some of those threads pass *through* the Newborn's network? Maybe her death isn't caused by the Newborn - but the Newborn is somehow *present* in every version of her death she sees. A witness. A constant. A thread she can't cut.

**Utility and Cost:**
Thread-sight becomes genuinely useful to the party:
- She can see Newborn influence on people
- She can track the Seeds' spread
- She might perceive fragment connections
- She could spot the Midwife's nature, or other transformed beings

But every use risks drawing more attention. The party gains a valuable tool; Prismara pays the price.

**The Central Question:**
Can she learn to look without being seen? Or does seeing always mean being seen back?

**Playing This Arc:**
- Don't rush the escalation - let it build across many sessions
- Small moments: she feels watched, threads seem to *move* when she looks at them
- The party should benefit from her sight before realizing the cost
- Her choice to keep using it (or stop) should be meaningful
- The Newborn's interest is not automatically hostile - it's *alien*

### Sensory Distortion as Foreshadowing

The hallucinations near the Incomplete are the first sign of what's coming. Use them as:

**A Warning System:**
- Distortion intensity = proximity to Newborn influence
- Mild distortion = Seeds present, transformation beginning
- Severe distortion = active transformation, Incomplete nearby
- Total sensory chaos = direct Newborn presence (the cave fragment, eventually the Newborn itself)

**A Contrast:**
- The Incomplete: chaotic, tangled, infinite possibilities (sensory overload)
- The Midwife: perfectly stable, every thread precise (eerily calm, almost *too* ordered)
- The Newborn fragment: overwhelming density of possibility (the Moment of Focus)
- The Newborn itself: ???

**An Escalation:**
1. **Current:** Distortion near Incomplete, thick air, walls going forever
2. **Cave Fragment:** More intense - she may struggle to function near it
3. **Post-Moment of Focus:** The distortions don't stop. She senses the Newborn's attention even when not near influence.
4. **Late Game:** Is she sensing the Newborn's network everywhere? Or is the network sensing *her*?

**The Key Insight:**
The distortions aren't her senses *failing*. They're her senses *expanding* beyond what they can handle. She's perceiving probability itself, and probability near the Newborn is infinite.

*She can't see the present, only what's coming. And what's coming terrifies her.*
