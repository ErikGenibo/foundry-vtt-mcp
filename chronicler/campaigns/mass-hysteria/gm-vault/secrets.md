## Divine Secrets

### Lolo is Meyel

**The Truth:** The Ysoki woman "Lolo" who spoke with Jax at the bar before he became Ringo is actually **Meyel**, the Pahtra goddess of luck, in mortal form.

**The Reveal (When Lolo Returns):**
> "My champion, my sweet chosen... I wasn't stopping your dance. I was asking you to take the lead."

**Key Points:**
- She appeared because Ringo needed someone to listen before changing his identity
- The "bad luck" since refusing the assassination isn't punishment - it's the cost of becoming the choreographer instead of the dancer
- Lolo will return for something big later
- When she does, remind Ringo: "Didn't you think it was odd that you bore your soul to a complete stranger immediately before changing your name and going on the run?"

**Thematic Core:** Agency vs. Destiny - Meyel is proud of Ringo for choosing to lead his own dance.

## Character Secrets

### Ringo (Jax Lionheart)

**Bounty Status:** #4 on the Galaxy-Wide Top 5 bounty board. Anyone with the Bounty app can see his face and former name.

**Who's Hunting Him:**
| Hunter | Status | Method |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Lyra "Ghost"** | **ACTIVE - Already watching** | Psych warfare, surveillance, mind games |
| **Gaxxus "The Breaker"** | Incoming | Digital tracking, direct confrontation |
| **Lysander Southpaw** | Potential | Personal grudge + Zenithcorp access |

**The "XOXO" Message:** Almost certainly from Lyra. Matches her MO exactly - surveillance photo from "a corner with no cameras," taunting tone, psychological pressure, threatening crew members.

**Lysander Connection:** Childhood nemesis now works security for Zenithcorp, which owns Aura Zenith (where Ringo refused to kill Julian Thorne). Could have inside knowledge.

### The 5th Life Sign

Ship registers 5 life signs with 4 crew. Possible explanations:
- **Driftdead** - Ship encounter creature noted in planning
- Something in the walls (sounds of movement noted as ship quirk)
- The "Strange Good" drift engine (possibly sentient?)
- Something from the cult compound
- Connected to Posie's nanites?

### Prismara's Precognition

Prismara (Vlaka Prismeni heritage) has genuine precognitive abilities - she "sees" through future-sight despite being blind. She's fleeing visions of her own death.

**Parallel with Bori:** Both are Vlaka. Bori "pretends" to be blind/deaf. Prismara actually is blind but sees through other means.

## Faction Secrets

### Cerulean Collective Structure

```
Director Nox (assumed identity, "other faces in many pies")
        |
   +----+----+
   |         |
Hand 1    Hand 2 ("The Opulent" - Charity)
(CC Inc)  (Underworld)
   |              |
Legal Front   DeepSphere boards
              Agent database
```

**Director Nox:**
- "Director" is an assumed identity
- Financially, politically, militarily, and (rumors suggest) *personally* powerful
- Publicly associated with both legal and underworld wings
- Has "other faces" with fingers in many pies

**The Opulent (Charity):**
- Human woman, plainly dressed, pleasant but no-nonsense
- Ringo met her several times for high-profile jobs
- Runs the underworld side of CC

**Ringo's Family Risk:**
- Parents (Boharaff & Jasumee) still laundering for CC
- The business is "too deep to pull out safely"
- Nox probably interrogated them about Ringo's whereabouts
- Player preference: Don't make "save my family" a main plot, but they're fair game as story elements

## Plot Secrets

### The Aura Zenith Job

**Target:** Julian Thorne, 9-year-old son of High Chancellor Anya Thorne (Ring of Nations, Verces)

**Why:** Unknown to Ringo. Likely:
- Political rival punishing Anya for vetoing a bill
- CC/megacorp putting pressure on a "good politician"
- Someone making Anya "compliant to higher powers"

**Anya Thorne:** One of the few good politicians in a corrupt government. Her son being targeted was retaliation for not playing ball.

**The Bent Rifle:** The barrel blocked a blast that would have killed Ringo. Even in his "bad luck" streak, Meyel protected him.

### Children of the Unseen Horizon

**What We Know:**
- Cult on Antares Prime
- Led by Bori Novoi (on bounty board)
- Party investigated their compound
- Found **Precursor ruins** (not recent construction)
- Bori connected to tentacles and a beast
- Possible connection to The Newborn (Aucturn's Child)
- Tu'Sev excised a "flesh burrito" from Ringo's face
- Cassie's daughter may need medical examination

**Open Questions:**
- Was the Newborn connection real or a front?
- What were those tentacles?
- How was the beast connected to Bori?

### Posie's Pull - Mother Swarm

**Destination:** Haunted Sif

**Evidence:**
- Nanites felt gravitational pull after leaving cult compound
- Direction: Away from compound AND Port Gelling, toward skyline
- Haunted Sif has "sorcerers" who control **ancient terraformer nanobots**
- The rings around the planet are **self-replicating androids**

**The Mother Swarm:** Likely the source of Haunted Sif's nanobot technology. Posie's friends recognize their kin.

**Posie's Future:** Player wants Posie to eventually be "ship of Theseus'd" - entirely composed of nanites. This is a problem to deal with later.

## Planned Reveals

| Reveal | Trigger | Impact |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Lolo = Meyel | When Lolo returns for something big | Ringo's faith crisis resolved |
| Lyra is watching | She makes her move | Combat/chase + paranoia |
| Duplicate ship on High Dromio | Party visits | Existential horror |
| Haunted Sif = Mother Swarm | Party arrives | Posie's arc climax |
| 5th life sign revealed | When dramatically appropriate | Horror/mystery payoff |

## Session Planning Notes

### 11/23 Planning
- Bori's room (loot, hooks for Tu'Sev)
- Port Gelling (tax-class civil robot, foreman foists sentient purple orb on Posie)

### Next Session: Sunday, Jan 18, 2026 at noon

**Status:** Party returned from Children of the Unseen Horizon compound. Recent developments:
- Anonymous "XOXO" message received by both Ringo and Prismara
- Tu'Sev noticed the cult compound was built on Precursor ruins
- Posie's friends felt a pull toward Haunted Sif
- Tu'Sev wants continued access to investigate the cult basement

**Possible Directions:**
- Follow up on the anonymous message
- Investigate Precursor ruins further
- Head toward Haunted Sif for Posie's quest
- Deal with Bori bounty
- Clear Purt's name (she was framed)
