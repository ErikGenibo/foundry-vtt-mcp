### Posie

> *See: `characters/posie.md` for full dossier*

**The Merge:** While helping Vesk move crates, accidentally released nanites. The nanites tried to engulf her. She hugged them. Now symbiotic.

**The Friends:** Nanite colony with tiny individuality within hive mind. Want to return to the Mother Swarm.

## Recent Events

### Children of the Unseen Horizon - Full Arc

**The Hook:** Cassie, a distraught lashunta mother, approached the party. Her daughter Jemini had vanished into a cult under the thrall of a charismatic leader.

**The Cult:** Servants of the Unseen Horizon, led by Bori Novoi - a Vlaka "priest" of the Newborn who preached rebirth and change. Guards and cameras everywhere. Cultists worked unpaid in service of this "change."

#### Infiltration (Several Days Undercover)

**Barracks - Guk & The Goblins:**
- Party met Guk the space goblin and his crew playing cards
- Goblins were mercenaries, not believers - paid to watch cultists for dissent
- Later, Ringo and Prismara sweet-talked Guk over cards: if they heard explosions, maybe their hearing would fail
- High diplomacy + promise of intro to Nana Sweetie sealed it

**Posie - Foreman:**
- Assigned to back room, discovered enhanced Niaqui production
- Drug made from unusual lichen (Tu'Sev knew this was wrong - niaqui isn't normally lichen-based)
- So helpful she was promoted to foreman
- Found the drug when investigating a broken crate (touched it, felt REALLY GOOD)

**Prismara - Engineering:**
- Surrounded by less proficient workers and manager
- Backdoored into compound systems
- Reassigned party members to optimal positions

**Tu'Sev - Lab Researcher:**
- Figured out the lichen clue
- True to form, improved the drug formula (better compound, fewer resources)

**Ringo - Temple Guard:**
- Stood ceremonial guard while Bori preached to throngs about change and rebirth
- Post-sermon, Bori approached: "Who are you? I don't recognize you."
- Ringo: "New temple guard."
- Bori: "Ah, then you must have gone through the initiation."
- Ringo (not knowing): "It was... fruitful."
- Bori (dark chuckle): "It certainly will be."
- Party knew the clock was ticking

**The Secret Door:**
- Found in a corner with no cameras
- Unable to open it at the time
- **This is the location from the XOXO photo** - Ringo at door, Prismara keeping lookout

#### The Initiation (Combat Session)

- Party gathered in chapel for Ringo's "initiation"
- Struck first - Prismara dropped a mine directly on Bori
- Bori activated the room: walls erupted into writhing tentacles that grabbed and drained panicking cultists
- Scuffle with zealots
- Bori escaped through unmapped tunnels to the **Precursor arena**
- Bori kept screaming "WE COULD HAVE BEEN GODS" - implying he planned to absorb the entire cult to power his apotheosis
- Bori was shot in the forehead and killed
- Tentacles dragged his corpse to center of arena
- Transformed into **Bori, Botched Apotheosis** - gibbering mass of eyes, mouths, and tentacles (a *botched* apotheosis because the party denied him his sacrifices)
- *"Bori thought he was communing with a god. He was standing in front of a river and asking it to make him special."*
- Party prevailed, signaled Nana for extraction

**The Epilogue:**
- Returned to barracks
- Guk at the table, feet up, lopsided grin
- His entire gang holding lab guards at gunpoint
- "Whaddya know? They didn't hear nothing neither."

#### Post-Session (Discord Downtime)

- Downtime activities completed
- XOXO message received (connects to secret door photo)
- **Jemini status: Severely brainwashed** - Cassie's daughter, original rescue target. Cried when Bori died, even after his transformation. Does not want to be "rescued."

#### Next Session Plan

**Rewind slightly** - before full extraction, party can investigate:
- Bori's secret bedroom (behind the hallway door)
- Treasure and narrative hooks for Tu'Sev
- Jemini's whereabouts?

### The Anonymous Message ("XOXO")

Two days after returning from the cult compound:
- Both Ringo and Prismara received holonet messages from anonymous proxy
- Image: Ringo at a secret door, Prismara keeping lookout
- Location was "a corner with no cameras"
- Text: "Love the new look, see you soon. XOXO"
- P.S.: "Who's your friend? Maybe I should get to know them too"
- Metadata analysis yielded nothing (double-blind proxy)
- **Almost certainly from Lyra "Ghost"** - matches her MO exactly

### The Pull (Posie's Friends)

While shuttling back from the cult compound:
- Friends went oddly silent, almost melancholy
- Then every friend was **SCREAMING** with a gravitational pull
- Direction: Away from compound AND Port Gelling, toward the skyline
- Destination: **Haunted Sif**

## Campaign Timers (Player Choices → Setting Consequences)

These are consequences triggered by player decisions. Track them here.

### Nana's Enhanced Niaqui Operation
**Trigger:** Party reveals the SOURCE of enhanced niaqui to Nana during debrief
**Status:** NOT YET TRIGGERED

If triggered:
- **Immediate:** Nothing visible. Nana thanks them for the intel.
- **Weeks later:** Nana sends people to investigate the Precursor ruins.
- **Months later:** Enhanced niaqui begins appearing in Port Gelling's drug supply.
- **Long-term:** The drug spreads. People start changing. The Newborn's influence grows through commerce instead of cult.

If they stay vague: Timer doesn't start. Nana investigates on her own (slower, may never find the source).

---

### Guk's Goblins
**Trigger:** Ringo speaks up for Guk during Nana debrief
**Status:** NOT YET TRIGGERED

If Ringo vouches:
- Guk and his crew become guards at the Precursor ruin entrance
- "Ringo's goblins" - his responsibility
- Potential allies for future ruin exploration
- Could cause problems if they get greedy or scared

If Ringo stays silent:
- Guk and crew get "cleared out" off-screen
- Broken promise - Guk trusted Ringo
- Could return as enemy, or just a tragedy

---

### Mira and the Remaining Cultists
**Trigger:** How party handles Mira (cult survivor who approaches them in Port Gelling)
**Status:** NOT YET TRIGGERED

Resolution options:
- **Help her disappear (Chk Chk):** Mira vanishes. Other cultists hear the party helped one of them. Could become contacts.
- **Take her to Cassie:** Messy confrontation. Cassie might turn her in or show mercy. Affects Cassie's arc.
- **Abandon her:** Mira's fate uncertain. Other cultists see party as threat, not potential help.

3-4 other scared cultists are hiding in Port Gelling, waiting to see what happens.

---

### The Midwife's Fate
**Trigger:** What party does with Vessel-of-Necessary-Change after rescuing her
**Status:** NOT YET TRIGGERED

Options:
- **Free her, let her tend the fragment:** Gains an alien ally. Fragment is properly maintained. Change flows correctly.
- **Free her, she leaves:** Gratitude, possible future contact. Fragment untended - consequences unknown.
- **Kill her:** One less aberration. But who tends the fragment now? Bori's crude methods may have damaged something.
- **Leave her imprisoned:** She's still being misused. Seeds of Flesh production could resume if someone else finds her.

---

### The Specimen Jar
**Trigger:** What happens to the preserved communion flesh sample
**Status:** IN PARTY'S POSSESSION

This is Newborn tissue. If it falls into wrong hands:
- Nana would pay well for it (and start her own experiments)
- Cog might want to study it (obsessed with transformation)
- Leaving it somewhere could be dangerous
- The Midwife could explain what it is

Currently: Nobody in Port Gelling wants to touch it.

### Dormant

| Thread | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Freighter Oasis Distress | On Montague-Alpha |
| Malfunctioning Warp Gate | On Haagenti-the-Beautiful |

### Hooks (Unengaged)

- Duplicate ship crash on High Dromio (with bodies matching crew?)
- Why did CC want Julian Thorne dead?
- The 5th life sign on the ship
- Medieval "sorcerers" on Haunted Sif
- Niaqui drug source on Sauriels-Garden
- Modified human colony on Vanth

---

## Established Lore

### The Precursors
- Ancient biotech civilization that nearly destroyed themselves
- Grey goo apocalypse - their nanites became too adaptive, consumed everything
- Last-ditch solution: fragment the nanites into single-purpose "personalities"
- Scattered fragments across the Antares system, each with one function:
  - **Sauriels-Garden:** Growth/connection fragment → the lichen
  - **Unknown planet:** Travel/aid fragment → Posie's friends
  - **Haunted Sif:** Unknown function → Mother Swarm
- The fragmentation halted the apocalypse but left dormant tech seeded everywhere
- **Danger:** If fragments reunite, they may regain adaptability. Grey goo 2.0.

### The Newborn
- NOT evil - just Change incarnate
- Doesn't *want* anything - it simply IS
- Where its presence touches, transformation happens
- Doesn't have human emotions - either impassive force or incomprehensible motives
- *"Bori thought he was communing with a god. He was standing in front of a river and asking it to make him special."*
- The "eggshell fragment" in the cave is remnant of PASSAGE, not birth - the Newborn moved through this place once
- The Newborn's presence may be CORRUPTING the Precursor containment system

### Posie's Friends
- NOT Vesk-made - Precursor nanites the Vesk found and tried to weaponize
- Travel/aid fragment - their original purpose was helping
- Received the Drift Signal when the beacon activated, built a ship, went looking for "help"
- Don't understand WHY they were fragmented/trapped
- Posie is unknowingly carrying a potential grey goo restart
- **Opposed to Newborn forces** - Precursor containment vs. Newborn change

### The Seeds of Flesh
- The "flesh burritos" / communion implants
- Newborn tissue that grows inside a host
- Being mass-produced by the Midwife AGAINST HER WILL
- Jemini has been exposed, slowly changing
- Stages: Subtle → Visible → Shifting → Transformation
