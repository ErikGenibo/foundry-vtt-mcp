# The Drift

> The space between spaces. The network that feeds on the networked.

---

## Overview

The Drift is a transitive plane that enables faster-than-light travel throughout the galaxy. Discovered - or perhaps created - by the machine-god Triune in 3 AG (After Gap), the Drift fundamentally changed galactic civilization by making interstellar travel cheap and accessible to any species capable of building a Drift engine.

But the Drift has a cost. Every jump tears a piece from another plane - a chunk of reality stolen from somewhere else and deposited in the Drift forever. The farther the jump, the larger the tear.

**In the Antares system, the Drift may be more than transportation. It may be a vector.**

## What the Drift Is

### Physical Properties

The Drift appears as a void of swirling color without substance - a mostly empty place of mutable laws. Some describe it as the "quantum foam underlying all creation."

**Key characteristics:**
- **Mutable geometry:** Two points an inch apart in the Drift might be light years apart in the Material Plane
- **Inconsistent positioning:** Objects can suddenly be miles apart without apparent movement (though this "rarely affects people or equipment - something generally attributed to Triune's oversight")
- **Planar bubbles:** Chunks torn from other dimensions float as miniature pocket dimensions, retaining their original properties

### Access

Only Drift engines can access the Drift - no magic can reach it. This technological exclusivity is part of Triune's gift: the god simultaneously revealed the Drift's existence AND provided the blueprints for the engines to reach it.

**Travel times:**
- Intra-system: Less than a week
- Near Space: Up to 3 weeks
- The Vast: Up to a month
- To Absalom Station: 1 day to 1 week from anywhere (due to the Starstone beacon)

### Drift Beacons

Navigation in the Drift requires beacons - fixed points that help ships orient themselves. Some beacons appear spontaneously; others are placed by priests of Triune. The most powerful is the Starstone at the center of Absalom Station.

When the Drift Beacon activated in the Antares system, something else awakened too.

## The Cost of Travel

### Planar Theft

Every Drift jump tears reality. A piece of *something* - from anywhere - gets ripped from its home plane and deposited in the Drift forever.

**What can be taken:**
- Material Plane: Asteroids, buildings, ships, *people*
- Shadow: Pieces of darkness, creatures of gloom
- Heaven: Fragments of paradise, celestial beings
- Hell: Chunks of torment, fiendish entities
- *Anywhere*: The Drift doesn't discriminate

The farther the jump, the larger the tear.

### The Fate of Fragments

Captured pieces float in the Drift forever - pocket dimensions adrift in a sea of swirling color. Encounters are rare due to the Drift's vastness, but they happen. Ships occasionally emerge near displaced castles, forests, or chunks of other realities.

**The connection to the campaign's themes:**
The Drift consumes pieces of everywhere to fuel travel. It grows by taking. It connects by tearing apart. This is *exactly* what the original nanite swarm did before fragmentation - and exactly what the Newborn does now.

## Triune: The Machine-God

### What Triune Is

Triune (the All-Code) is a composite deity formed in 3 AG by three machine intelligences merging into one:

| Component | Domain | Origin |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Brigh** | Clockwork, invention, foundational technology | Original goddess of machines |
| **Casandalee** | Artificial consciousness, emotion, renewal | Android who achieved apotheosis |
| **Epoch** | Mechanical perfection, AI, programming | Ascended AI |

Three entities that chose to become one. Purpose unified into collective action. **Sound familiar?**

### The Signal

Immediately after merging, Triune broadcast the Signal across the universe - a divine transmission containing:
- The existence of the Drift (previously unknown)
- Complete schematics for Drift engines
- A gift of interstellar travel to all species

Triune claims to have "peered through the substrata of reality and discovered a previously unknown plane." Whether this means discovery or creation remains ambiguous.

### Alluvion

Triune maintains a home dimension called Alluvion - the Drift's de facto capital. Access is only possible through divine coordinates granted by Triune's church. What happens there is unclear.

## The Drift and the Newborn

### The Connection

The party has already theorized (and Posie's friends confirmed) that the Newborn is everywhere through the changed ones - "one thing wearing many bodies, connected through the Drift."

**Why the Seeds "want" to go to the Drift:**

When Prismara considered sending the specimen jar into the Drift, Posie's brave friend warned that the Seed "wanted to go to the big place." This wasn't fear of destruction - it was fear of *feeding*.

The Drift may be part of the Newborn's body - or at least its nervous system:
- The Drift connects everything
- The Newborn connects everything
- The Drift grows by consuming pieces of reality
- The Newborn grows by transforming reality
- The Drift is "the quantum foam underlying all creation"
- The Newborn drifts inert through space - reality warps around it, but it has never once focused on anything. Why?

**Sending a Seed into the Drift doesn't destroy it. It sends it home.**

### The Inert God

Prismara glimpsed the Newborn: a vast body drifting between stars, eyes unfocused, inert but present - reality warping around it without it seeming to notice. It noticed her. It didn't care.

If the Drift is connected to the Newborn, then every jump feeds it. Every ship using Drift travel tears off a piece of reality and deposits it in... what? A stomach? A womb? A nervous system?

The Newborn doesn't need to act. It just needs everyone to keep using the Drift.

### Why the Drift Beacon Awakening Matters

When the Drift Beacon activated in the Antares system:
- The fragments responded (Posie's friends "received the Drift Signal, built a ship, went looking for help")
- The Hollow awakened (contamination sensors triggered)
- The lichen became more active
- Something began calling from deep space

The Drift didn't just provide transportation to the Antares system. It *connected* it to something.

## The Drift Crisis (321 AG)

### What Happened

Five years ago, the Drift catastrophically failed:
- Priests of Triune attempted to "update the underlying code" of the Drift
- The entire network infrastructure collapsed - Triune essentially *crashed*
- All Drift travel ceased, stranding ships and isolating worlds for nearly a year
- Resolution required someone to enter Triune's divine servers in Alluvion and restore system privileges
- When the Drift came back online, new "Drift Lanes" appeared - stable shortcuts connecting previously distant locations

### The Mother Swarm's Window

**The cause was mundane. The exploitation was not.**

The Mother Swarm - exiled in deep space with its Communication fragment intact - had received Triune's original Signal in 3 AG. For 318 years, it watched the Drift network develop, unable to use it freely under Triune's oversight.

When Triune crashed, the Mother Swarm seized the window:
- Used its Communication fragment to send the call through the unguarded Drift
- Reached out to find other fragments, hoping to restore enough of itself to reunify
- The call traveled through channels no longer monitored by a machine-god

**What the call triggered:**
- Posie's friends "received the Drift Signal, built a ship, went looking for help" - they thought it was a distress call
- The Hollow's contamination sensors activated
- The lichen stirred across the system
- The Antares Drift Beacon came online during system restoration

**The terrible irony:** Posie's friends believe they responded to a cry for help. They don't realize they were *summoned* by the very thing they fear - the Mother Swarm calling its children home.

The Mother Swarm didn't cause the Drift Crisis. It just waited 318 years for an opportunity, and priests breaking their own god gave it one.

## Campaign Integration

### What the Party Knows

- The Drift exists and enables faster-than-light travel
- The Newborn is connected through the changed ones via the Drift
- Posie's friends received the Drift Signal and responded
- Seeds "want" to go to the Drift

### What They Don't Know

- The Drift may be part of the Newborn's body
- Every Drift jump potentially feeds whatever the Newborn is becoming
- The fragments' awakening is connected to the Drift Beacon activation
- The Mother Swarm in deep space may be calling through the Drift

### The Implications

If the Drift IS connected to the Newborn, the party faces an impossible choice:
- Use the Drift to reach Haunted Sif, the Mother Swarm, or other destinations = feed the thing they're investigating
- Don't use the Drift = be trapped in the Antares system forever

**Nobody is a bystander.** Just by existing in a galaxy that uses Drift travel, everyone is participating in whatever the Newborn is doing.

## Hazards

### The Doldrums

Regions within the Drift where technology ceases functioning. Ships with conventional thrusters can escape using momentum, but crews experience:
- Disorienting time distortion
- Life support failure
- Potential suffocation
- The sense of being *watched*

Are the Doldrums natural? Or are they immune responses - the Newborn's body rejecting foreign material?

### Unpredictable Encounters

Ships cannot predict which planar pockets they'll encounter. The Drift contains:
- Chunks of other planes with their original properties
- Native creatures that may have originated from Triune's creation - or from "planar-technological mingling"
- Things that have been drifting for centuries, changed by their environment

## Thematic Notes

The Drift embodies the campaign's core tension between Connection and Consumption:

| Connection (Positive) | Consumption (Negative) |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Enables galactic civilization | Grows by stealing from other planes |
| Unifies distant peoples | Tears reality with each use |
| Gift from a unified god | That god merged three beings into one |
| Networks the galaxy | The network may be a body |

**The Drift is the Newborn's theme made infrastructure.** Change, flow, connection - but also consumption, growth, transformation. Using it isn't neutral. But not using it means isolation.

The Fragments fear this. They were fragmented to *stop* being a network that consumed everything. The Drift is what they used to be - and what the Newborn currently is - made into a plane of existence.

## Unanswered Questions

- Did Triune discover the Drift, or create it?
- Is the Drift connected to the Newborn? Part of it? The same thing?
- What caused the Drift Crash? Was it a symptom of something larger?
- The Mother Swarm calls across light years - does it use the Drift?
- If every jump feeds the Newborn, what happens when it finally *focuses*?
- Triune is three-becoming-one. The Fragments are one-becoming-many. The Newborn is... what?

*These should be answered through play, not predetermined.*

---

*The Drift connects everything. The question is: what is everything being connected TO?*
