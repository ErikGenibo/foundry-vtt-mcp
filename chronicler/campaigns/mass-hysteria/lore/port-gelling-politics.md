# Port Gelling Politics

> Nobody is a bystander. Not even on the ground floor.

---

## The Mundane Mirror

The cosmic conflict between Precursors, Newborn, and Fragments plays out in the stars. But the same principle - nobody gets to stay neutral - applies at street level in Port Gelling.

The party works for Nana Sweetie. They may not think of themselves as "Nana's people," but everyone else does. Every job they take, every favor they accept, every time a Sweetiebot escorts them through the compound - they're being watched. Categorized. Filed away as assets or threats.

**They have already made enemies they haven't met yet.**

---

## Nana's Position

Nana Sweetie controls Port Gelling. But "control" is a strong word for a boomtown less than five years old, built on contested ground, full of people running from something or chasing something.

She has power. She does not have *security*.

### What Nana Has
- The Sweetiebot network (surveillance, enforcement, presence)
- First-mover advantage (she was here when the Beacon activated)
- The port infrastructure (docking fees, fuel, repairs)
- Reputation (everyone knows crossing her is fatal)
- The sealed Precursor site under Port Gelling (leverage she hasn't used yet)

### What Nana Doesn't Have
- Legitimacy (she's a crime lord, not a government)
- Monopoly on violence (other factions have muscle)
- Control of the system (Port Gelling is one settlement on one planet)
- Youth (she's 100+ and mortal, probably)
- Loyalty (she has employees and allies, not believers)

### Nana's Enemies

Anyone who wants what she has. Anyone she's stepped on to get here. Anyone who sees opportunity in her eventual decline.

## Factions in Port Gelling

### The Corporate Interests

**Who:** Off-world megacorps who see Antares as untapped resources. Mining, pharmaceuticals, weapons manufacturing, biotech.

**What They Want:** Access, extraction, profit. They don't care about Port Gelling politics - they care about what's under the ground and in the system.

**Relationship to Nana:** Uneasy tolerance. She controls the port; they need the port. But they'd replace her in a heartbeat if they could install someone more... cooperative.

**How the Party Made Enemies:**
- The enhanced niaqui source is worth billions. If corps learn the party knows where it comes from, they become targets.
- Any Precursor tech the party discovers is corp-level valuable. People will kill for that information.
- The party disrupted the cult. Some of that disruption may have affected corp supply lines or research subjects.

**Potential Corp Antagonists:**
- **Chlo Foods Inc.** - The party's FIRST corporate enemy. See below.
- Zenithcorp (already connected to Ringo via Lysander Southpaw)
- Biotech firms interested in the "transformation" phenomenon
- Mining operations that hit Precursor sites and want to know more

---

### Chlo Foods Inc. (Active Threat)

**What They Are:** A food corporation with research operations in the Antares system. They were genetically modifying fungus to reproduce and harvest valuable exotic food ("Space Truffles") from an asteroid base.

**What Happened (Session 1):**
The party was sent by Nana to deal with "smugglers" on an asteroid that was on collision course with Antares Prime. They found no smugglers - instead, they found:
- A Chlo Foods research facility
- Will Kommen, a hardlight corporate mascot, who told them they were trespassing
- Automated security turrets (which they destroyed)
- Computer Glitch Gremlins causing the malfunction
- Genetically modified fungal creatures (which they killed and ate)
- Malfunctioning reactors (which Prismara fixed)

**What the Party Did:**
- Trespassed on corporate property
- Destroyed security systems
- Killed research subjects
- Fixed the reactor (saving the asteroid... which Chlo Foods still owns)
- Left without reporting to anyone

**What Chlo Foods Knows:**
- Their asteroid facility went dark
- Security logs will show intruders
- Research subjects destroyed
- Someone fixed the reactor (saving their property, ironically)
- They don't know WHO yet... but they will investigate

**Escalation Path:**
1. **Investigation:** Chlo Foods reviews logs, finds evidence of intrusion
2. **Identification:** Someone recognizes the Mass Hysteria, or Nana's involvement is traced
3. **Response:** Legal action? Hired muscle? Corporate "security consultants"?
4. **Confrontation:** The party meets Chlo Foods representatives who want answers

**The Irony:**
Nana sent them after "smugglers." There were no smugglers - just a malfunctioning corporate facility. The party did Nana's dirty work without realizing the full picture. Now they have a corporation as an enemy, and Nana knew exactly what she was sending them into.

**GM Notes:**
This is a perfect "nobody is a bystander" moment. The party thought they were doing a simple job. They made a corporate enemy on day one. Chlo Foods isn't evil - they're just a company that got robbed. The party is, technically, the bad guys here.

### The Independent Operators

**Who:** Criminals, smugglers, mercenaries, and opportunists who don't work for Nana but operate in her territory.

**What They Want:** Their own slice. Freedom to operate. Maybe to eventually challenge Nana's dominance.

**Relationship to Nana:** Hostility ranging from cold war to active conflict. She tolerates small players; she eliminates anyone who gets too big.

**How the Party Made Enemies:**
- Guk's goblins are dead. Word spreads: "Port Gelling people work with the grandmother-machine."
- The party took out a cult that was *someone's* customer (drug supply, labor, information)
- Every successful job for Nana is advertising: "We're her people."

**Potential Independent Antagonists:**
- Goblin survivors seeking revenge or answers
- Drug suppliers whose product got disrupted
- Mercenaries who lost contracts when the cult fell
- Opportunists who see the party as a way to hurt Nana

---

### The Desperate

**Who:** Settlers who came here for a fresh start. Workers who can't leave. People who owe debts they can't pay.

**What They Want:** Survival. Maybe escape. Maybe just one good break.

**Relationship to Nana:** Dependent, resentful, trapped. She provides stability, but at a cost. Some are grateful. Some are waiting for a chance.

**How the Party Made Enemies:**
- The cult recruited from the desperate. Some of those people had families who blame *whoever destroyed the cult* for their loss.
- Jobs that benefit Nana often hurt the people she exploits. Debt collection, eviction enforcement, "messages" delivered.
- The party has resources. That alone creates resentment.

**Potential Desperate Antagonists:**
- Families of cult victims who see the party as murderers
- Workers who got caught in crossfire
- People who need what the party has and can't ask nicely

---

### The Bounty Network

**Who:** The galaxy-wide bounty hunting ecosystem. Anyone with the app can take a contract.

**What They Want:** Credits. Reputation. The thrill.

**Relationship to Nana:** Officially neutral - bounty hunters are tools, not factions. Unofficially, Nana uses them when convenient and eliminates them when they're inconvenient.

**How the Party Made Enemies:**
- Ringo is #4 on the Galaxy-Wide Top 5. Anyone could be hunting him.
- Lyra is already watching. She knows about Prismara now too.
- The party's growing reputation makes them worth more as targets.

**Current Hunters:**
| Hunter | Status | Method | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Lyra "Ghost"** | ACTIVE | Psych warfare, surveillance | Already sent "XOXO" message |
| **Gaxxus "The Breaker"** | Incoming | Digital tracking, direct assault | Weeks away? |
| **Lysander Southpaw** | Potential | Personal grudge + corp resources | Childhood nemesis, Zenithcorp access |

---

### The Void

**Who:** Things from outside. The Newborn's influence. Precursor systems activating. The spaces between.

**What They Want:** Nothing human. They don't want - they ARE.

**Relationship to Nana:** She knows something is under Port Gelling. She built around it. She's playing a game she doesn't fully understand.

**How the Party Made Enemies:**
- They touched Precursor ruins. They're in the system now.
- They encountered Newborn influence. Proximity is participation.
- They carry a specimen jar with something that wants to *plant*.
- Posie carries a fragment that other fragments might seek.

**The Void Doesn't Send Antagonists:** It just includes you in processes you don't understand. But its *servants* might take notice. Other Midwives. Other cults. Things that sense the Newborn's touch and come to investigate.

---

## Specific Enemies the Party Has Made

### Already Active

**The Goblins' Network**
- Guk is dead. 12 goblins killed.
- Other goblins in the system know.
- *"Port Gelling people? You work with the grandmother-machine."*
- Potential survivor seeking revenge, answers, or help

**Lyra "Ghost"**
- Actively surveilling Ringo
- Has identified Prismara as leverage
- Playing psychological warfare
- Will escalate on her timeline, not theirs

**Nana's Unspoken Expectations**
- The party revealed the Midwife/Newborn source to Nana
- She now expects access to whatever they find
- Holding out on her will have consequences
- She's patient, but she's keeping score

### Brewing (Unknown to Party)

**Cult Remnants**
- 3-4 cultists hiding in Port Gelling (Davros, Kellix, Venn, maybe Zara)
- Some want help. Some want revenge. Some are still transforming.
- The "completed" cultists (fully transformed, look human) are watching

**Corporate Interest**
- Someone is going to notice the enhanced niaqui supply got disrupted
- Someone is going to ask where the source was
- That trail leads to the party

**The Families**
- The cult had members who had families
- Those families lost people
- Some blame Bori. Some blame the "mercenaries" who destroyed the compound.

### Future (Not Yet Triggered)

**Whoever Nana's Real Enemies Are**
- She didn't build an empire without stepping on people
- Someone wants her gone
- The party is now visibly associated with her
- When someone makes a move against Nana, they might start with her "contractors"

**Gaxxus "The Breaker"**
- Coming for Ringo
- More direct than Lyra
- Less subtle, more dangerous in a fight

**The Cerulean Collective**
- Still hunting Ringo (as Jax Lionheart)
- His parents still launder for them
- Director Nox has "other faces in many pies"
- They haven't found him yet. They will.

## The Bystander Problem

Every time the party does a job, they create ripples:

**Taking a job for Nana:**
- Marks them as her assets
- Makes them targets for her enemies
- Creates obligations she'll collect on later

**Refusing a job for Nana:**
- Signals they might be unreliable
- Opens the door for competitors
- Might insult her (bad idea)

**Helping someone against Nana's interests:**
- Directly antagonizes the most powerful person in Port Gelling
- Burns a bridge they might need
- But might create new allies...

**Staying neutral:**
- Not actually possible
- Everyone already has them categorized
- Inaction is just slow-motion choice

The party walked into Port Gelling as nobodies. They took a job from Cassie. Nana noticed. They cleared a cult compound. Nana sent extraction. They reported to Nana. They're now her people, whether they signed up for it or not.

**Nobody is a bystander.**

## GM Notes

### Introducing Enemies Naturally

Don't dump all of this on players. Let them discover it:

- A goblin spits at them in the market. Why?
- Someone's watching from a rooftop. Who?
- A job offer comes with a warning: "Nana won't like this." Does that matter to them?
- A stranger asks about the cult compound. What did they really see there?

### Escalation Path

1. **Small signs:** Cold shoulders, whispered conversations, being watched
2. **Pressure:** Job offers from Nana's rivals, veiled threats, prices going up
3. **Conflict:** Someone makes a move - robbery, ambush, blackmail
4. **Crisis:** A faction declares open hostility

### The Party's Choices

Every session should include at least one moment where the party's faction alignment matters:

- Who do they help?
- Who do they report to?
- What information do they share?
- What do they keep secret?

Their answers build their reputation. Their reputation determines who helps them and who hunts them.

*In Port Gelling, everyone is someone's enemy. The only question is whether you know whose.*
