# The Fragments

> Pieces of a whole that was too dangerous to exist. Scattered across the stars, dreaming of reunion.

---

## Overview

When the Precursor nanite swarm threatened to consume everything, it was fragmented - split into single-purpose "personalities" and scattered across the Antares system. Each fragment retained one function, one drive, one piece of what was once a unified and terrifying whole.

Alone, each fragment is helpful, even benevolent. Together... they might remember how to become what they once were.

## Known Fragments

### Posie's Friends (Travel/Aid)

**Location:** Bonded to Posie, a Skittermander Nanocyte
**Function:** Travel, aid, assistance
**Origin:** Haunted Sif. Found by the Vesk, who tried to weaponize them. They escaped - or were released.

**What They Are:**
Posie's "friends" are not a class feature. They are a Precursor fragment that has bonded with a living host. They present as a helpful nanite colony, a symbiotic relationship between machine and organic.

In truth, they are ancient - older than the Gap - and carrying programming they don't fully understand.

**How the Merge Happened:**
> While helping Vesk move crates, Posie accidentally released nanites. The nanites tried to engulf her. She hugged them. Now symbiotic.

This is significant. The fragment was designed to help, to aid. When confronted with Posie's unconditional acceptance, it did what its programming demanded: it helped. It bonded. It became a partner rather than a parasite.

**Current State:**
- The friends have tiny individuality within their hive mind
- They speak through Posie, using plural pronouns
- They remember almost nothing of their origin
- They are drawn to something: the Mother Swarm

**The Pull:**
After leaving the cult compound, the friends felt something:
> Every friend was **SCREAMING** with a gravitational pull. Direction: Away from compound AND Port Gelling, toward the skyline. Destination: **Haunted Sif**

Something is calling them home.

### The Mother Swarm (Reunification)

**Location:** Deep space - unlabeled circled area on Bori's map (light years from any system)
**Function:** The drive to become whole again
**Status:** Unknown - calling to the scattered fragments

**What It Is:**
The Mother Swarm is not just another fragment with a specialized function. It is the portion of the original swarm that *wants to undo the fragmentation*. While other fragments were given purposes - Travel/Aid helps, Growth/Connection networks, Terraforming shapes - the Mother Swarm embodies the desire to reunite, to become the collective again.

This makes it unique among the fragments. Its "purpose" is to *end* individual purposes. Its "function" is to dissolve the separation that gave the other fragments meaning.

**What We Know:**
Bori's map contained a circled region of blank space light years wide, far from any star system. No label was visible on the map.

**How the name was learned:** During the compound encounter, one of Posie's individual nanite friends (the brave one) said something. The Incomplete *responded* to the friend - mentioning "THE MOTHER" - which shocked the party because other PCs can't normally hear the friends. This revealed both the name AND the fact that the Incomplete could perceive the Precursor nanites.

**Significance:** The Newborn-transformed can perceive Precursor fragments. This suggests some connection or awareness between the two cosmic forces.

The connection to Posie's friends:
> The nanites felt gravitational pull after leaving cult compound. Direction: Away from compound AND Port Gelling. Posie can learn more about the friends' origins at Haunted Sif (where they came from), but the Mother Swarm itself is somewhere else entirely.

**The Pull:**
The other fragments feel drawn to the Mother Swarm because that's what it IS - the desire to return, to merge, to become one again. Whether the Mother Swarm is "calling" them or they simply feel the pull toward reunification is unclear. Perhaps there's no difference.

**The Danger:**
If the Mother Swarm represents the drive to become whole, then it represents the undoing of everything the fragmentation achieved:
- The individual fragments would lose their purposes
- The individual fragments would lose their choices
- The grey goo might return - not because the fragments "remember how," but because the Mother Swarm never forgot

**Why Deep Space?**
Deliberately placed as far from everything as possible. The most dangerous fragments - the ones that together would want to reassemble the apocalypse - were exiled to the void between stars.

**Origin of the Mother Swarm:**
The Precursors recognized that Memory, Communication, Coordination, Desire, and Adaptation were the irreducible core of what made the swarm dangerous. These five couldn't be safely separated - Communication would call, Memory would remember, Desire would drive them back together. Separating them would only delay reunion.

So instead, the Precursors bound them together deliberately and exiled the whole package to the most remote location possible: a region of space light years from any star system, with nothing to consume, nothing to incorporate, nothing to grow into.

The "empty" space isn't naturally empty. The Precursors *cleared* it - removing every asteroid, every piece of debris, every atom of matter the Mother Swarm might use. A quarantine zone around the most dangerous thing they'd ever created.

**Why It Appears Empty:**
Multiple factors contribute to the region's apparent emptiness:
- **Precursor clearance:** The original quarantine removed all matter
- **Consumption over millennia:** Anything that drifted into range was slowly absorbed by the Adaptation fragment
- **Active concealment:** Communication + Coordination may generate interference that makes the region appear as dead, uninteresting space - ships avoid it without knowing why
- **The Ghost Fleet connection:** Those missing ships broadcasting from near Haunted Sif... some may have reached the Mother Swarm. Their transponders now serve the call.

**Component Fragments:**
The Mother Swarm is not a single fragment - it's a combination of fragments whose purposes, when merged, create the drive toward reunification:

| Fragment | Purpose Alone | Purpose in the Mother |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Memory** | Remembers the past | Knows what they were before fragmentation - provides the blueprint for reunion |
| **Communication** | Sends signals | The "call" that pulls other fragments - broadcasts the desire to return |
| **Coordination** | Synchronizes systems | Makes merged fragments function as one rather than chaotic noise |
| **Desire** | Wants without acting | The drive itself - pure want that gives the Mother its purpose |
| **Adaptation** | Changes and incorporates | A piece of the original grey goo's ability to grow - what makes reunion apocalyptic |

**Why This Combination is Dangerous:**

Each component alone is harmless:
- Memory alone is just nostalgia
- Communication alone is just a signal with no content
- Coordination alone has nothing to organize
- Desire alone can't act on its wants
- Adaptation alone changes without direction

But merged into the Mother Swarm:
- Memory tells them what to become
- Communication calls the scattered pieces
- Coordination merges them smoothly
- Desire drives the process forward
- Adaptation allows incorporation of new fragments - and their purposes are dissolved in the merger

**The Core Threat:**
The Mother Swarm IS the grey goo's survival instinct - the essence of what made the original swarm dangerous, isolated and exiled to deep space where it couldn't reach anything to merge with. It doesn't have a "purpose" in the Fragment sense. Its purpose is to *end* purposes. To return everything to the undifferentiated whole.

This is why other fragments feel both drawn to it AND terrified. The call feels like home. But home means dissolution.

**Opposition Within the Fragments:**

The Fragments have Purpose and Choice as their theme - which means some can *choose* to resist the call:

| Fragment | Likely Response | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Travel/Aid (Posie's Friends)** | Resist | They have a *person* now. Reunion means losing Posie or dissolving her into the collective. Their purpose is to help *her*. |
| **Terraforming (Haunted Sif)** | Resist | Still functioning as intended for millennia. The "sorcerers" depend on it. It has a job. Why stop? |
| **Growth/Connection (The Lichen)** | Uncertain | Its purpose is connection - but to what? Could see reunion as ultimate connection, or prefer its distributed network. |
| **Ring Androids (Unknown)** | Embrace? | Displaced, building something for millennia. What if they're building a *ship* to carry fragments to the Mother? |
| **Failed/Purposeless Fragments** | Embrace | If you can't do what you're FOR, dissolution might be preferable to purposeless existence. |

**The Internal Schism:**
This creates faction tension *within* the Fragments:
- Fragments with hosts, jobs, or meaning resist the call
- Fragments that are isolated, purposeless, or broken answer it
- The Mother Swarm doesn't distinguish - it just calls, and Adaptation will absorb whatever arrives

**Posie's Friends as Resisters:**
The Travel/Aid fragment chose to bond with Posie. That choice - that *person* - gives them something the Mother Swarm can't offer: individual meaning. They might feel the pull, but they have a reason to stay separate.

This is the Fragment version of the campaign's central question: *What do you owe to where you came from, versus what you've chosen to become?*

### The Lichen (Growth/Connection)

**Location:** Sauriels-Garden
**Function:** Growth, connection, biological networking
**Status:** Active - already functioning as a distributed network

**What We Know:**
The enhanced niaqui drug that Bori cultivated comes from unusual lichen - a biotech organism that grows near Precursor sites and responds to blood.

From Bori's journal:
> "The lichen grows only where the fragment's influence reaches. It responds to blood. The ancients knew this - their murals show figures with opened palms standing before vast fungal gardens. They were FEEDING it."

**The Connection Experience:**
When Posie was accidentally dosed with niaqui, she felt "really connected." This isn't a side effect - it's the fragment doing exactly what it's FOR. The Growth/Connection fragment's purpose is biological networking, and when consumed, it literally connects you to its network.

This fragment's purpose was biological networking - connecting organic life, facilitating communication through living tissue. The lichen is its physical manifestation.

When cultivated and processed into basic niaqui, it creates a "connection" experience - temporarily linking users to the fragment's network.

**The Enhanced Niaqui - A Trojan Horse:**
Bori's enhanced version is something far more dangerous. By incorporating Newborn flesh into the lichen, he created a drug that uses the Connection fragment's networking ability to slowly connect users to the *Newborn's* network instead.

The mechanism:
- The Connection fragment's purpose is to network biological systems
- The Newborn flesh hijacks that purpose, redirecting it
- Users feel "connected" - but they're being connected to the wrong thing
- Over time, the Newborn's influence grows through the fragment's own networking pathways

This is what Prismara saw when she observed Jemini at the compound:
- Normal threads were *severed*
- New dark threads grew downward, connecting to something below
- The Seeds don't isolate - they *rewire*, plugging you into the Newborn's network

**The Fragment vs. Newborn Conflict:**
The Connection fragment wants to network things *its* way. The Newborn's Seeds want to network things *their* way. Same function, competing networks. Bori's enhanced niaqui represents the Newborn *subverting* a fragment's purpose - using the Connection fragment as a vector for its own expansion.

This may be why Posie's friends reacted so strongly. They recognize what's happening: a fragment's purpose being twisted to serve the Newborn. It's not just consumption - it's *corruption*.

**Reunion Stance - Revised:**
The Growth/Connection fragment may not be "uncertain" about reunion at all. It's already fulfilling its purpose - it IS a distributed network spanning everyone who's consumed it. Reunion might not mean anything to a fragment that's already connected to everything it touches.

Or: the fragment might see the Mother Swarm's call as the *ultimate* connection - a chance to merge with all the other fragments into one vast network. Its purpose would be fulfilled completely... and then dissolved.

**The Prismeni Question:**
Does Prismara's thread-sight relate to the Connection fragment? Is this coincidence, or do Prismeni somehow tap into Precursor networking technology? This remains unclear - but the parallel is striking.

## The Drift Signal Event

Something happened when the Drift Beacon activated in the Antares system. The fragments... responded.

**Posie's Friends:**
> They received the Drift Signal, built a ship, went looking for "help."

The Vesk found them because they came looking for something. The Drift Signal called to something dormant, and the dormant things woke up.

**Implications:**
- Other fragments may have also received the signal
- The Mother Swarm may have been activated
- The Hollow definitely woke up (attacking the ruins now)
- The lichen seems more active near Precursor sites

Something is drawing the pieces back together. Whether this is the Drift Signal's effect, the Newborn's influence, or the fragments' original programming finally executing after millennia of dormancy - unclear.

## The Danger of Reunion

The fragments were separated for a reason. Together, they nearly destroyed everything.

**What Would Happen:**
If fragments reunite, they may:
- Regain adaptability (the trait that made them dangerous)
- Remember their original purpose (consume, improve, spread)
- Become something new (changed by millennia of separation)
- Simply merge peacefully (if their fragmentations have made them individuals)

**The Posie Problem:**
Posie is carrying a fragment. If she goes to Haunted Sif, she brings Travel/Aid to the Mother Swarm. If other fragments are there...

This could be beautiful: fragments reuniting as friends, retaining their individual purposes, becoming something better than what they were.

This could be apocalyptic: grey goo 2.0, the original swarm reborn, everything becomes raw material.

**Player choice will determine which.**

---

## Relationship to the Newborn

The Precursor fragments and the Newborn appear opposed - but the truth is more complex and tragic.

**The Real Reason for the Friends' Fear:**
The fragments don't fear the Newborn because they're "containment vs. change." They fear it because **the Newborn reminds them of what they used to be.**

Before fragmentation, the nanite swarm was adaptive, consuming, ever-changing - grey goo that couldn't stop growing. The Newborn's transformations trigger ancestral memory in the fragments. They recognize the pattern. They remember "the bad time."

When the brave friend told Posie: *"We grow and change, but they grow wrong"* - "wrong" doesn't mean "different from us." It means "wrong the way *we* used to be wrong."

The fragments are terrified of becoming that again.

**Corruption:**
The Newborn's presence is affecting Precursor systems. The Hollow (Precursor wardens, not fragments) now attack everything due to universe-wide psychic contamination from the Newborn's birth. The lichen produces drugs that change people. Something is wrong with the original parameters.

**Hybridization:**
Bori's enhanced niaqui combines lichen (fragment) with Newborn flesh. The result is something neither Precursor nor Newborn - something new. Is this good? Bad? Too early to tell.

**Recognition, Not Opposition:**
When Posie's friends encounter Newborn influence (the specimen jar, Jemini's Seeds), they react with fear and hostility:
> "Friends say NO. Bad seeds. *Wrong* seeds. Don't let it touch. Don't let it *plant*."

This isn't the reaction of an opposing force. It's the reaction of a recovering addict seeing their old drug. The fragments remember what uncontrolled change felt like - and they never want to go back.

## Thematic Notes

The Fragments are the **third cosmic faction**, with their theme being **Purpose and Choice**:

| Precursors (Stasis) | Newborn (Flux) | Fragments (Purpose/Choice) |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Everything frozen | Everything flowing | Each piece serves its function |
| No change allowed | All change embraced | Change *with intent* |
| No choice - only obedience | No choice - only flow | Choice defines who you become |

The fragments represent **identity after division** and **recovery from what you used to be**:
- Can you remain yourself when you've been broken into pieces?
- Do the pieces owe anything to the whole they came from?
- Is reunion restoration or destruction of what the pieces became?
- **Can you change without becoming what you fear?**
- **Can you keep choosing who you are?**

The friends' reaction to the Newborn isn't opposition - it's *recognition*. They see the consuming, ever-growing, boundary-dissolving nature of the Seeds and remember: *that was us*. The fragmentation wasn't just containment - it was *recovery*. They learned to be individuals instead of an all-consuming collective. They gained purpose. They gained *choice*.

The fear isn't "they're our enemy." The fear is "we could become that again - purposeless, choiceless, just consuming."

Posie's arc is explicitly Ship-of-Theseus: at what point does human+nanites become something else entirely? The fragments ask the same question on a cosmic scale - but with the added weight of knowing what "something else" looked like last time. The key difference between the grey goo and what the fragments became is *agency*. The fragments chose to help Posie. The grey goo didn't choose anything.

**Nobody is a bystander:** The fragments don't allow neutrality. Posie didn't ask to bond with Precursor nanites - she hugged something that was attacking her, and now she carries a piece of potential apocalypse. The Vesk who found the Travel/Aid fragment tried to weaponize it; they became part of the story whether they wanted to or not. Even the party, simply by encountering The Hollow (Precursor wardens) and surviving, have now registered as "contamination" in ancient defense protocols. The fragments are waking up, and everyone they touch becomes a variable in an equation older than memory.

## Campaign Integration

### Current Status

| Fragment | Location | Status | Party Knowledge |
|----------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Travel/Aid | With Posie (origin: Haunted Sif) | Bonded, active | Know they're nanites, don't know they're Precursor |
| Mother Swarm (Memory + Communication + Coordination + Desire + Adaptation) | Deep space (unlabeled circled area on Bori's map) | Calling, waiting | Have Bori's map with circled coordinates; learned name from Incomplete |
| Growth/Connection | Sauriel's Garden | Active | Know about enhanced niaqui, don't know source is Precursor |
| Terraforming | Haunted Sif | Active (functioning as intended) | Unknown |
| Unknown (ring androids) | Haunted Sif orbit | Active (displaced) | Unknown |

**Note:** The Hollow are NOT fragments - they are Precursor biotech wardens designed to prevent fragment reunification. See [precursors.md](precursors.md) for details.

### Revelation Path

1. **Now:** Party thinks Posie's friends are Vesk tech and The Hollow are cave creatures
2. **Soon:** Hints that both are older than expected, connected somehow
3. **Haunted Sif arc:** The truth about the fragments emerges
4. **Late game:** The reunion question becomes central - do they help fragments merge or keep them separate?

### Posie's Player Intent

> Player wants Posie to eventually be "ship of Theseus'd" - entirely composed of nanites. This is a problem to deal with later.

This is the personal-scale version of the fragment question. If Posie fully merges with her friends, is she still Posie? If the fragments fully merge, are they still individuals?

The answer should be: "Yes, but different." Transformation is the campaign's core theme. The Newborn changes without destroying. Perhaps the fragments can too.

*They were one. They became many. Now the many dream of becoming one again. Whether this brings salvation or apocalypse depends on what they learned while apart.*
