# The Precursors

> Clockwork architects of stasis, undone by their own perfection.

---

## Overview

The Precursors were an advanced biotech civilization that existed before the Gap - predating even the Akashic Record. Their technology blurred the line between living and mechanical, organic and constructed. They built the "channels" that run throughout the Antares system.

**Their Philosophy:** Order. Stasis. Control. The Precursors believed that entropy was the enemy - that change itself was a disease to be managed. Their entire civilization was built around maintaining perfect equilibrium, preventing decay, freezing everything in its optimal state forever.

They nearly destroyed themselves - and everything else - through grey goo apocalypse. Their nanites became too adaptive, too hungry, consuming everything in their path. In desperation, they fragmented their creation, splitting the nanite swarm into single-purpose "personalities" scattered across the system.

It worked. The apocalypse halted. But the Precursors were gone, leaving only ruins, dormant technology, and sleeping fragments waiting to be awakened.

**The Irony:** A civilization dedicated to preventing change was undone by creating something that changed too much.

## What We Know

### The Grey Goo Event

The Precursor nanites were designed to adapt, to improve, to spread. They did this too well. At some critical threshold, the nanites stopped distinguishing between "build" and "consume." Everything became raw material.

**The solution:** Fragment the swarm. Split the unified nanite consciousness into isolated "personalities," each locked to a single function. Alone, each fragment was harmless - even helpful. Together, they might regain their terrifying adaptability.

The fragmentation scattered across the Antares system:
- **Sauriel's Garden:** Growth/Connection fragment → the lichen
- **Haunted Sif:** Travel/Aid fragment → Posie's friends (origin point)
- **Haunted Sif:** Terraforming fragment → the "magic" nanobots (functioning as intended)
- **Haunted Sif orbit:** Unknown fragment(s) → the ring androids (displaced from intended location)
- **Deep space (unlabeled circled area on Bori's map):** The Mother Swarm → a merger of Memory, Communication, Coordination, Desire, and Adaptation fragments - the grey goo's survival instinct, exiled as far from everything as possible

**Note:** The Hollow are NOT fragments - they are Precursor biotech wardens, separate from the swarm. See below.

### The Channels

The Precursors built a network across the system - not just physical structures, but pathways for... something. Energy? Information? Change itself?

Cassie's husband Talven called them "channels" before he walked into the desert:
> "They're conduits. For something to flow through. Something that wasn't supposed to flow anymore, but is starting to again."

The Newborn's presence may be corrupting these channels - or perhaps the channels were always meant to carry something like the Newborn. The relationship between Precursor technology and cosmic forces remains unclear.

### The Ruins

Precursor structures exist throughout the Antares system:
- **Cult compound (Antares Prime):** Built atop Precursor ruins. The "arena" where Bori transformed.
- **50 klicks east:** Collapsed structure, outline visible from air
- **Under Port Gelling:** Nana built around something old and sealed. Deliberately.
- **Haunted Sif:** The "sorcerers" use Precursor nanotech disguised as magic

## Technology

### Biotech Philosophy

Precursor technology is neither fully organic nor fully mechanical - it's both, seamlessly integrated. Their constructs are grown as much as built, programmed as much as bred.

Key characteristics:
- **Self-repairing:** Precursor constructs can heal/regenerate if given time
- **Environmentally responsive:** They adapt to conditions without external input
- **Networked:** Individual units coordinate without visible communication
- **Ancient programming:** Still following directives from before the Gap

### The Hollow (Precursor Wardens)

Soulless biotech wardens created to prevent the fragments from remerging. **NOT fragments themselves** - they are guardians, not pieces of the swarm.

**Purpose:** Keep watch over the scattered fragments. Prevent reunification. Purge anything that might facilitate the fragments coming back together.

**Appearance:**
- Chitinous, insectoid, dog-sized
- Compound eyes, mandibles
- Too symmetrical, too precise
- "Bleed" vapor, not blood
- Difficult to identify as artificial due to the nature of Precursor biotech

**Kinematic Replication:** The Hollow can self-replicate through movement/action - creating more of themselves as needed.

**Why They're Active Now:**
The Hollow were dormant for millennia. The Newborn's birth spread a usually undetectable amount of psychic contamination across the universe. This triggered the Hollow's contamination sensors - but now they detect *everything* that isn't them as contamination to be purged. They attack indiscriminately: the fragments they were meant to guard, Precursor sites, organic life, everything.

> The party encountered The Hollow in the cave ruins. The Midwife calls them "the clean ones" who wish to make everything "tidy."

**The Tragic Irony:** Built to protect the fragments, now they attack everything - including the fragments themselves.

### Dormant Systems

Much of what the Precursors left behind is sleeping, waiting to be activated:
- Drift Beacon signal may have triggered some awakenings
- The lichen on Sauriels-Garden responds to blood
- Posie's friends were dormant until they "received" something
- The Hollow were dormant until the Newborn's birth triggered their contamination sensors

## The Gap Problem

The Akashic Record - the cosmic repository of all knowledge - doesn't contain the Precursors. When Tu'Sev touched the mural rubbing and tried to access Akashic memory:

> "The Akashic doesn't record this civilization. They PREDATE the record."

This implies the Precursors existed before whatever created the Gap - or that they were deliberately excluded. Perhaps they erased themselves. Perhaps something else erased them.

When Tu'Sev tried to read The Hollow, he got only static - a sense of *oldness*, then nothing. The information slipped away. The Akashic can't hold it.

---

## Relationship to the Newborn

The Precursors and the Newborn represent two different cosmic principles:
- **Precursors:** Control, containment, fragmentation, stasis
- **Newborn:** Change, growth, transformation, flow

The Midwife suggests they understood each other:
> "The old ones who built these tunnels understood. They did not worship the Newborn, but they *respected* it. They built channels - ways for Change to flow without flooding."

The Precursor solution (fragmentation) may have been inspired by observation of cosmic forces - dividing something too dangerous into manageable pieces. But now the Newborn's presence is corrupting Precursor containment. The "channels" are filling with something they weren't designed to carry.

## Implications for the Campaign

### Current Threats

1. **The Hollow are awakening.** Bori's meddling activated defense systems. More may follow.

2. **The fragments are being drawn together.** Posie's friends felt a "pull" toward Haunted Sif. Something is calling the scattered pieces home.

3. **The channels are corrupted.** The Newborn's influence is spreading through infrastructure designed to contain it.

### Future Hooks

- **The circled deep space coordinates:** Light years from any system. The Mother Swarm - what function does it serve? What happens when fragments reunite?
- **Under Port Gelling:** What did Nana's construction crews find? Why did she build around it?
- **Talven:** Cassie's husband walked into the desert understanding something. Is he dead? Transformed? Still out there?
- **The Stasis Vaults:** See below.

### The Stasis Vaults (Major Arc Hook)

Somewhere in the Antares system, there are structures designed to hold the Precursor race in suspended animation - waiting for the crisis to be resolved, waiting to return when it was "safe."

**The Setup:**
The party discovers evidence of these vaults. Signs that the Precursors didn't die - they *waited*. They put themselves into stasis until their systems reported that the threat level had returned to acceptable parameters.

**The Tension:**
Something is activating. Signals suggest the vaults might be preparing to open. The Precursors might be about to wake up. Given their philosophy of absolute control and their clockwork approach to the universe, their return could be catastrophic for everyone currently living in "their" system.

**The Adventure:**
The party races to prevent the awakening. They fight through Hollow guardians, navigate ancient security systems, discover the truth about what the Precursors really were...

**The Twist:**
When they finally reach the control systems, they discover: there was never any danger.

The Precursors set their awakening threshold at **100% safety**. Zero contamination. Zero chaos. Zero change. Perfect stasis restored across the entire system.

That threshold can never be met. It *could* never be met. The universe doesn't work that way. Change is fundamental to existence.

The Precursors are still in their vaults. They will always be in their vaults. They built a perfect trap for themselves - waiting for a "safe" that cannot exist.

**The Horror:**
They're not dead. They're still in there. Waiting. Forever. For something that will never come.

**Thematic Resonance:**
This is what absolute commitment to Stasis looks like. The Precursors couldn't accept any change, any risk, any imperfection. So they froze themselves waiting for perfection - and perfection never arrives.

It's a warning about Posie's journey: the opposite extreme from the Newborn's endless flux is just as deadly. The answer isn't total control OR total chaos. It's something else entirely.

### The Danger

If the fragments reunite, they may regain their original adaptability. Grey goo 2.0. Everything in the Antares system - and beyond - becomes raw material.

Posie is unknowingly carrying a piece of this potential apocalypse. Her "friends" are a fragment that might, under the right conditions, remember how to consume.

## Thematic Notes

### The Three Cosmic Factions

The Precursors are one of three cosmic factions in the campaign:

| Faction | Theme | Philosophy |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Precursors** | Stasis/Control | Freeze everything in optimal state forever |
| **Newborn** | Change/Flux | Everything flows, transforms, becomes |
| **Fragments** | Purpose/Choice | Each piece serves its function by choice |

**The Irony:** The Precursors' solution to grey goo - fragmentation - accidentally created the third faction. By breaking the swarm into single-purpose pieces, they gave those pieces something the original swarm lacked: meaning and agency. The Fragments now embody Purpose and Choice, themes completely alien to both the Precursors' rigid control and the Newborn's boundless flux.

### Stasis vs. Flux

The Precursors and the Newborn represent opposing cosmic principles:

| Precursors | Newborn |
|------------|---------|
| Order | Chaos |
| Stasis | Flux |
| Control | Freedom |
| Preservation | Transformation |
| Everything frozen forever | Everything flowing always |
| No choice - only obedience | No choice - only flow |

**Neither is right. Neither is wrong. Both are inhuman.**

The Precursors wanted to freeze the universe in its "perfect" state. The Newborn wants everything to flow and change eternally. Both philosophies, taken to their extreme, are incompatible with mortal life - which needs *some* change (growth, learning, healing) but also *some* stability (identity, relationships, meaning).

### The Question the Campaign Asks

Is fragmentation safety or just delayed catastrophe? What happens when the Fragments reunite - do they keep their purposes and choices, or revert to purposeless grey goo?

**Nobody is a bystander:** The Precursors didn't just observe the grey goo threat - they broke themselves apart to stop it. Their ruins aren't passive archaeology; they're active systems still executing ancient directives. Anyone who enters a Precursor site becomes part of the machinery, whether they understand it or not. Tu'Sev seeking knowledge, Nana building over sealed doors, the cultists worshipping in the arena - all of them became participants the moment they touched Precursor works.

## GM Notes

### Revelation Pacing

The Precursor truth should unfold slowly:
1. **Early:** "There are old ruins. Nobody knows who built them."
2. **Middle:** "The ruins are connected. They predate the Gap."
3. **Late:** "There was a civilization here. They made something terrible. They broke it apart to survive."
4. **Climax:** "The pieces are coming back together."

### Obfuscation

Players should NOT immediately understand:
- The Hollow are Precursor tech (they look like cave bugs)
- Posie's friends are connected to the ruins
- The lichen, the nanites, and the Mother Swarm are all fragments of the same original swarm

Let them piece it together. The "aha" moment should feel earned.

*What they built still watches. What they broke still dreams of being whole.*
