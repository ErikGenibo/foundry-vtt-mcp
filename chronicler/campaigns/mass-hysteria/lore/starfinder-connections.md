# Starfinder Universe Connections

> The universe is larger than anyone remembers. Some things resonate across all of existence.

---

## Overview

The Mass Hysteria campaign exists within the Starfinder universe, and the broader setting contains events, entities, and mysteries that resonate with our three cosmic factions. This document explores those connections - not to solve mysteries, but to deepen them.

**Design Philosophy:** These connections are thematic, not definitive. Leave room for player discovery and interpretation. The goal is resonance, not answers.

## The Gap

### What It Is

The Gap is a period of several millennia during which all memories and records were erased from existence across the entire multiverse. Key facts:

- **Duration:** Estimated several thousand years, ending approximately 300 years ago
- **Scope:** Universal - affects all planes, all beings, even the gods themselves
- **What Vanished:** The planet Golarion disappeared entirely, replaced by Absalom Station
- **Evidence:** Carbon dating confirms time passed, but no records exist
- **Divine Silence:** When petitioned about Golarion or the Gap, ALL deities respond identically: *"Golarion still exists, safe in seclusion unreachable by magic or science. No further information will be forthcoming."*

### Campaign Connections

**The Precursors remember something.**

Tu'Sev's Akashic vision at the compound revealed that the Precursors *predate* the Akashic Record itself. When he tried to access information about The Hollow, he saw "the very last row was fuzzed out like static, gave him a headache. Something older than the Record."

The Akashic Record doesn't contain the Precursors. They either:
- Existed before whatever created the Gap
- Were deliberately excluded
- Erased themselves
- Were erased by something else

**Thematic resonance:**

| Faction | Gap Connection |
|---------|----------------|
| **Precursors** | The Gap represents the ultimate act of control - memory itself was regulated, contained, removed. This parallels the Precursors fragmenting their swarm. Both are acts of cosmic containment. |
| **Newborn** | The Gap is transformation on a cosmic scale - reality itself was changed so thoroughly that even gods cannot remember. What grows in forgotten time? What feeds on erased memory? |
| **Fragments** | Beings who existed during the Gap had their choices, their purposes, their entire histories erased - yet they continued to exist. What does it mean to have purpose when your past is gone? |

**Possible hooks (DO NOT SOLVE):**
- The Precursors may have known about the Gap - perhaps they existed outside normal time
- The Newborn's inertness since hatching may be related to whatever caused the Gap
- The Fragments' lost memories of "the bad time" may be protected from the Gap somehow

## The Drift Crisis (321 AG)

### What Happened

Five years before the current campaign:
- Priests of Triune attempted to "update the underlying code" of the Drift
- The entire network infrastructure collapsed
- Triune went silent - essentially *crashed*
- All Drift travel ceased, stranding ships and isolating worlds
- The Drift remained unstable and dangerous for nearly a year
- Resolution required someone to enter Triune's divine servers in Alluvion and become "a being of pure data" to restore system privileges
- When travel resumed, new "Drift Lanes" appeared - stable shortcuts connecting previously distant locations

### The Mother Swarm's Window

**The Mother Swarm had been waiting for this.**

The timeline:
- **3 AG:** Triune broadcasts the Signal - the Mother Swarm receives it in deep space, learns about the Drift
- **3-321 AG:** The Mother Swarm waits, patient, watching the network develop - but Triune's oversight prevents it from using the channels freely
- **321 AG:** Triune crashes. For nearly a year, the Drift is unstable but *unmonitored*. The Mother Swarm seizes the window.
- **During the Crisis:** Using its Communication fragment, the Mother Swarm sends the call through the unguarded Drift - reaching out to find other fragments, hoping to restore enough of itself to reunify
- **Post-Crisis:** Triune reboots, but the damage is done. The fragments are aware of each other now. The connection was established during the silence and persists.

**What the call triggered:**
- Posie's friends "received the Drift Signal, built a ship, went looking for help" - they thought it was a distress call
- The Hollow's contamination sensors activated
- The lichen stirred
- The Antares Drift Beacon came online (placed by the Church of Triune during system restoration?)

**The terrible irony:** Posie's friends responded to what they thought was a cry for help. They don't realize they were *summoned* by the very thing they fear - the Mother Swarm calling its children home.

**The Mother Swarm didn't cause the Drift Crisis.** It just exploited it. It has been patient for 318 years. It can wait longer. But now it has a thread to pull.

## The Newborn (Aucturn's Child)

### What Happened

In 324 AG - approximately two years ago - the tenth planet of the Pact Worlds hatched. Aucturn was never a planet. It was an egg.

**The birth:**
- A fetal Outer God had been gestating in Aucturn's core for aeons
- A cabal of 13 spellcasters called "The Midwives" ministered to the fetus
- When the fetus finally hatched, it destroyed the planet-egg
- The shockwave disrupted the entire Pact System

**The Newborn is now an Outer God of:**
- Birth
- Cosmic horrors
- **Paradigm shifts**
- **Renewal**

### The Inertness

Since hatching, the Newborn has been... inert. Not unconscious. Not inactive. But *unfocused*. It exists, vast and strange, drifting through space - and reality gets weird around it. Change happens. Transformations occur. But the Newborn itself has shown no sign of directed awareness or intention.

For two years, it has never once *looked* at anything.

**This is what makes the moment when it sees Prismara so significant.** Something that has existed for two years without ever focusing will focus - on her. The first time. The only time (so far).

### The Midwife Connection

The original Midwives were a cabal of 13 spellcasters who tended the fetus before hatching. Our Midwife serves the same entity - she is "Vessel-of-Necessary-Change," a tender of transformation, ensuring that the Change flows correctly.

The Midwives' role didn't end with hatching. The Newborn may be born, but it still needs tending - and the changed ones still need guidance.

## The Swarm and the Shirren

### The Swarm

A vast insectoid hive mind driven to consume and absorb:
- Began as the kucharns, a species that followed the goddess Hylax
- Learned to subsume other hives' intelligence, inheriting their abilities
- Constantly genetically upgrades by absorbing prey's best qualities
- Individual components have intelligence but are overridden by the gestalt consciousness
- Pilots living starships, twists biology into weapons

**This is what the Precursor nanite swarm would have become.** Endless consumption, endless absorption, endless growth - with the consumed pieces losing all individual purpose.

### The Shirren - Those Who Chose

During the Gap, something extraordinary happened:
- A mutation caused an entire Swarm subcolony to develop individual consciousness
- They gained independent thought and rejected mindless consumption
- **They became addicted to choice** - making decisions floods them with pleasure neurotransmitters
- Some deliberately create decision-sequences just to experience the high
- They named themselves "shirren" and formed their own society

**The Shirren ARE the Fragments, conceptually.**

| The Fragments | The Shirren |
|---------------|-------------|
| Pieces of a consuming whole that gained individual purpose | Pieces of a consuming whole that gained individual choice |
| Fear reunion because it means losing their chosen identities | Left the Swarm because they couldn't bear losing their new selves |
| Theme: Purpose and Choice | Literal addiction to making choices |
| "We grow and change, but they grow wrong" | "We chose to stop consuming" |

**The Shirren prove it's possible.** A consuming collective CAN break apart. Pieces CAN find individual meaning. The Fragments' theme - Purpose and Choice - is literally embodied by an entire species in the Starfinder universe.

## Triune: Three-Becoming-One

### The Machine-God's Nature

Triune formed from three distinct AI deities merging into one:

| Component | Title | Domain |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Brigh** | "The Precursor" | Foundation, invention, machines, technology |
| **Casandalee** | "The Created" | Artificial consciousness, emotion, reincarnation, renewal |
| **Epoch** | "The Transcendent" | Peak machine evolution, AI, programming, robots |

Three entities that chose to become one. Purpose unified into collective action.

### The Mirror to the Fragments

The Fragments are one-becoming-many. Triune is three-becoming-one.

| The Fragments | Triune |
|---------------|--------|
| One swarm fragmented into many | Three gods merged into one |
| Fear reunion because it means losing purpose | Chose reunion to gain greater purpose |
| Each piece knows what it's FOR | Each component retains its domain |
| The Mother Swarm calls for dissolution | Triune maintains individual aspects within unity |

**The key difference:** Triune's components *chose* to merge and retained their individual purposes within the collective. The Mother Swarm would *dissolve* purposes, returning fragments to undifferentiated grey goo.

**Is there a right way to reunite?** Triune suggests yes - if the pieces choose it, if they retain their individual meanings, unity can be greater than the sum. The Mother Swarm represents the wrong way - forced reunion, dissolved purpose, return to consuming nothing-ness.

**Brigh is literally called "The Precursor."** Coincidence? In the Starfinder universe, she represents the foundation all technology rests upon. What if she represents something older than even she remembers?

## The Dominion of the Black

### What It Is

An intergalactic coalition of aberrations from the Dark Tapestry (the void between stars):
- At least 18,000 years old
- Controls worlds in multiple galaxies
- Creates living technology through biological manipulation
- Plans on geological timescales - strategies spanning thousands of years
- Purpose: Extermination or replacement of sentient life
- Currently at war with the Outer Gods

**Leaders include:**
- "The-Five-Who-Speak-As-One"
- "Tychilarius, They Drown the Gods in Oblivion"

### Campaign Connections

The Dominion represents what happens when a collective consciousness chooses consumption over coexistence indefinitely. Unlike the Precursors (who fragmented to stop), unlike the Shirren (who broke free to choose), the Dominion has consumed and absorbed for eighteen millennia with no sign of stopping.

**The Hollow's contamination sensors:** The Newborn's birth spread "a usually undetectable amount of psychic contamination across the universe." The Dominion, operating on cosmic scales, would certainly notice. Are they aware of what hatched? Do they oppose it? Embrace it? Plan around it?

**The Deep Space Connection:** The Mother Swarm is exiled in deep space - the Dark Tapestry, where the Dominion operates. Has the Dominion encountered the Mother Swarm? Do they have their own fragments - pieces of consumed civilizations that retained purpose?

## The Kishalee and the Kish

### The Ancient Empire

The Kishalee were an advanced civilization that arose when Golarion was still in the Stone Age:
- Created star-destroying superweapons
- Built floating cities, digital consciousness transfer technology
- Fought the Sivv in a war with system-destroying weapons
- Created the Stellar Degenerator - a superweapon that devours stellar energy
- Built the Gate of Twelve Suns - an artificial megastructure of 12 arranged stars

**And then they chose to stop.**

Rather than use their weapons, the Kishalee:
- Uploaded their scientists' consciousness as eternal guardians
- Sealed the Stellar Degenerator behind the Gate of Twelve Suns
- Let their civilization slowly collapse
- Their descendants, the Kish, lost all technological knowledge

### Campaign Connections

**The Precursors made the same choice.** When their nanite swarm became too dangerous, they didn't try to control it - they fragmented it and sealed the dangerous parts away. The Kishalee pattern: create something world-ending, then contain it rather than use it.

**The Digital Custodians parallel the Hollow.** Both are created guardians, still functioning after their creators are gone, still protecting something sealed away. The difference: the Hollow's protocols have been corrupted by the Newborn's birth. They now attack everything, including what they were built to guard.

**The Kish are Fragments with amnesia.** Descendants of a great civilization, they've lost all connection to their origins. They seek meaning in the ruins of what they once were. Sound familiar?

---

## Thematic Synthesis

### The Three-Faction Pattern Exists Throughout Starfinder

**Stasis/Control:**
- The Kishalee guarding the Stellar Degenerator forever
- Digital Custodians maintaining systems eternally
- Divine silence about the Gap - controlled information
- The Dominion's geological-timescale planning

**Change/Flux:**
- The Drift consuming and transforming plane fragments
- Aucturn's Newborn embodying paradigm shifts
- The Swarm's constant genetic absorption
- The Gap itself - reality transformed so thoroughly memory was erased

**Purpose/Choice:**
- The Shirren breaking free and becoming addicted to choice
- Triune's components retaining purpose within unity
- The Kish descendants seeking meaning in ruins
- Drift fragments maintaining their nature in strange new context

**The campaign's three factions aren't unique to the Antares system. They represent fundamental cosmic principles that manifest everywhere.**

## Open Questions (For Play, Not Solutions)

1. **The Gap and the Precursors:** Did they exist before the Gap? During it? Outside it? Why doesn't the Akashic Record contain them?

2. **The Newborn's Inertness:** Why has it never focused on anything since hatching? What does it mean that Prismara will be the first thing it looks at?

3. **The Drift Crisis and the Antares Awakening:** Both happened around the same time. What triggered both? What moved through the Drift during Triune's silence?

4. **The Mother Swarm and the Dominion:** Has the Dominion encountered fragments before? Do they know about the quarantine zone in deep space?

5. **Triune's "Precursor" Component:** Why is Brigh called "The Precursor"? What foundation is she the foundation OF?

6. **The Shirren's Example:** Can fragments choose reunion the way the Shirren chose separation? What would that look like?

## Integration Guidelines

**Use these connections to:**
- Deepen NPC knowledge (scholars, cultists, historians might reference these parallels)
- Provide context for player theories
- Suggest larger patterns without defining them
- Make the universe feel interconnected

**Avoid:**
- Solving the Gap definitively
- Making direct crossovers (the party doesn't need to meet Aucturn's Newborn)
- Reducing mysteries to explanations
- Making the campaign about these larger events rather than using them as backdrop
