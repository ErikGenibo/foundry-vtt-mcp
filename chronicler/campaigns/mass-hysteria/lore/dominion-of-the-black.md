# The Dominion of the Black

> They who dwell between stars remember everything. They forget nothing. They forgive less.

## What They Are

The Dominion of the Black is an intergalactic coalition of aberrations based in the Dark Tapestry - the void between stars. They are ancient, patient, and utterly alien.

**Key Facts:**
- At least 18,000 years old (predates Earthfall on Golarion)
- Controls worlds across multiple galaxies
- Views humanoids as test subjects, raw material, or genetic manipulation fodder
- Uses living cybernetic ships fused with engineered oozes ("shipminds")
- Ultimate goal: extermination or replacement of sentient life with "something from another reality"

**Leadership** includes entities with names like:
- "The-Five-Who-Speak-As-One"
- "Infinity-Ceases-Now"
- "Tychilarius, They Drown the Gods in Oblivion"

## The Ancient Grudge

The Dominion and the Precursors were philosophical opposites who existed contemporaneously:

| Dominion | Precursors |
|----------|------------|
| Endless consumption | Controlled containment |
| Absorb everything | Fragment everything |
| Growth without limit | Stasis without end |
| Replace reality | Preserve reality |

**They were enemies.** Not in a war of fleets and battles - in a war of principles. The Precursors built containment; the Dominion broke containment. The Precursors fragmented threats; the Dominion consumed fragments. Each undid the other's work across millennia.

The Dominion could never break Precursor containment directly. The defenses were too sophisticated, too self-sustaining. But they watched. They waited. They remembered.

---

## The Quarantine Zone

When the Precursors exiled the Mother Swarm to deep space, the Dominion noticed.

**They have been observing for millennia:**
- Mapped the quarantine zone's boundaries
- Catalogued energy signatures and behavioral patterns
- Intercepted fragmentary Precursor communications
- Watched the Mother Swarm call across the void
- Noted when the fragments began to stir

**They cannot break the quarantine.** Precursor defenses still function, still reject intrusion. The Dominion has tried - subtly, patiently, over centuries - and failed.

But they can point others at it.

## The Dead Drop

When the party eventually needs information about the Mother Swarm's location, they will find a Dominion data-cache. This is not coincidence. This is not helpful. This is a millennia-old grudge finding expression.

### What the Cache Contains

**Navigation Data:**
- Precise coordinates of the quarantine zone
- Safe approach vectors (and dangerous ones)
- Energy signatures to look for
- Warning signs of active defenses

**Observation Records:**
- The Mother Swarm's behavioral patterns over centuries
- Cycles of dormancy and activity
- Responses to the Drift Beacon activation
- Notes on the "call" it sends to fragments

**Precursor Intercepts:**
- Fragmentary communications from the original containment
- References to "the dangerous pieces" and "the survival instinct"
- Warnings about what happens if the fragments reunite
- A sense of desperation: *"If this fails, there is no second containment"*

**The Dominion's Commentary:**
Cold, clinical observations with an undertone of satisfaction:
- *"The Precursors imprisoned something of themselves here"*
- *"Their children dream of reunion. How touching."*
- *"Let purpose meet purposelessness. Let the fragments find their grandmother."*
- *"We will observe the outcome with interest."*

### Why They're Helping

The Dominion isn't helping. They're using the party.

**Possible Outcomes (All Acceptable to the Dominion):**

1. **The party destabilizes the quarantine** → The Mother Swarm escapes, Precursor works fail, chaos spreads. The Dominion gains data and satisfaction.

2. **The party strengthens the quarantine** → The Dominion learns how Precursor defenses work, information useful for future attempts.

3. **The party is consumed** → One less group of humanoids. The Dominion doesn't care.

4. **The fragments reunite successfully** → Grey goo 2.0 emerges. The Dominion watches a new apex predator be born - and plans accordingly.

5. **Nothing happens** → The Dominion loses nothing. They've waited 18,000 years. They can wait longer.

## How to Introduce This

### Discovery Context

The data-cache should be found in a location that makes sense:
- A derelict ship in deep space with Dominion biotech
- Precursor ruins with evidence of ancient Dominion intrusion attempts
- A corrupted data node that someone (Bori? Venn?) was studying
- A fragment of the Drift that contains Dark Tapestry material

### Tone

The cache should feel:
- **Ancient** - This information has been waiting for millennia
- **Alien** - The Dominion's perspective is utterly inhuman
- **Clinical** - They observe without emotion, record without judgment
- **Satisfied** - A subtle undertone of pleasure at finally having a use for this data

### Red Flags

The party should realize:
- This information was *meant* to be found
- Someone wants them to go to the quarantine zone
- That someone is not their friend
- But the information itself appears accurate

---

## GM Notes

### When to Use This

- When the party needs to find the Mother Swarm
- When Tu'Sev researches Precursor history and finds evidence of ancient enemies
- When the party investigates the circled coordinates on Bori's map
- Late campaign, when they're ready for the Mother Swarm confrontation

### What the Dominion Knows

- The quarantine zone exists and what's in it
- How Precursor containment works (in general terms)
- That the fragments are stirring
- That someone will eventually try to reach the Mother Swarm

### What the Dominion Doesn't Know

- The specifics of Posie's friends or their bond with her
- The Newborn's connection to the fragments (or they'd be more concerned)
- What will actually happen if the fragments reunite
- Whether the party matters at all

### What the Dominion Doesn't Care About

- The party's survival
- The Antares system's fate
- Whether their grudge causes catastrophe
- Anything smaller than galactic scales

## Connection to Campaign Themes

The Dominion represents a fourth approach to existence:

| Faction | Theme |
|---------|-------|
| Precursors | Stasis/Control |
| Newborn | Change/Flux |
| Fragments | Purpose/Choice |
| **Dominion** | **Consumption/Replacement** |

The Dominion is what the original nanite swarm would have become if the Precursors hadn't intervened - endless growth, endless absorption, endless hunger. They are the fragments' darkest possible future, and the Precursors' ultimate nightmare.

They are also, in this moment, useful. The party needs their information. The price is becoming a piece in a game older than human civilization.

---

*They watch from the spaces between. They remember the Precursors. They have waited eighteen thousand years for this.*

*They can wait a little longer to see how it ends.*
