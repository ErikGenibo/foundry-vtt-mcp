# The Newborn

> Change incarnate. Not a god who grants wishes - an ocean that grants drowning.

## What the Newborn Is

The Newborn is not a creature, not a god, not an entity with wants or plans. It is a **cosmic principle given form** - Change itself, embodied.

It does not want anything. It simply IS. Where its presence touches, transformation happens. Not because it desires transformation, but because that is its nature - like fire burns without malice, like rivers flow without intention.

> "Bori thought he was communing with a god. He was standing in front of an ocean and asking it to make him special."
> — The Midwife

The Newborn does not love its servants. It does not hate its enemies. It does not have enemies. It is indifferent in the most profound sense - not choosing to ignore, but fundamentally incapable of the focused attention that caring would require.

Except... something may be changing. (See "The Prismara Connection" - a future event.)

## Origin and Nature

### Aucturn's Child

In 324 AG - approximately two years ago - the Newborn hatched from Aucturn, the planet-sized egg at the edge of the Pact Worlds system. The birth was catastrophic: Aucturn shattered into millions of pieces, forming a vast debris field. Magic went haywire across the galaxy. Planets shifted in their orbits. People experienced bizarre visions of cracking shells and cosmic upheaval.

The Newborn is exactly what its name suggests: *new*. A nascent Outer God, barely two years old, still learning what it is. The fetus gestated for eons - but the god itself has existed for less than three years.

**Since hatching, the Newborn has been... inert.** Not unconscious. Not inactive. But *unfocused*. It exists, vast and strange, drifting through space - and reality gets weird around it. Change happens. Transformations occur. But the Newborn itself has shown no sign of directed awareness or intention.

It is young. It is vast. It simply *is* - and that's enough to warp everything nearby.

### The Holy Trait

Despite being an aberration by conventional taxonomy, Newborn servants can carry the **holy** trait. The Midwife is "an aberration with the holy trait."

This suggests the Newborn is not evil in the cosmic sense. Change itself is neutral - neither creative nor destructive, but containing both. The Seeds of Flesh can create something beautiful (if tended properly) or something horrific (if forced, like Bori did).

The Newborn is sacred to those who understand what it actually is. The problem is that most who encounter it misunderstand completely.

## The Eggshell Fragment

What the party found in the Precursor ruins is not a piece of the Newborn's birth. It is a remnant of **passage** - the cosmic equivalent of afterbirth.

> "The 'eggshell' is not a remnant of birth - it is a remnant of *passage*. The Newborn moved through this place once. What remains is afterbirth. Potent. Sacred. Very dangerous to those who do not understand."
> — The Midwife

The fragment:
- Still pulses, still lives in some sense
- Radiates the Newborn's presence
- Draws the Incomplete (those seeking completion)
- Is protected by Precursor defense systems (The Hollow)
- Was exploited by Bori to produce Seeds of Flesh

The Midwife was brought here to tend the fragment - nurture it, keep it healthy, ensure the Change it radiates flows properly. Bori imprisoned her and forced her to mass-produce Seeds instead, perverting her function.

## Seeds of Flesh

The "flesh burritos" - communion implants that grow inside a host, connecting them to the Newborn's presence.

### Proper Planting

When Seeds are planted with intention, tended with care, guided by someone who understands:
- The host transforms gradually, beautifully
- The change aligns with the host's nature
- The result is something new but not wrong
- The host remains sapient, connected but not consumed

### Improper Planting

What Bori did - mass production, forced implantation, no guidance:
- The Seeds grow wrong
- The transformation is agonizing, incomplete
- The host becomes The Incomplete - stuck mid-change, suffering
- If the transformation "completes" without guidance, the result is a vector (spreader) not a vessel (container)

### Jemini's Infection

Jemini received Seeds during "initiation preparation" but the process was never completed. She is Stage 1 - the Seeds are growing but haven't taken hold.

| Stage | Timeframe | Symptoms | Reversibility |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Stage 1 | 0-48 hours | Subtle: dark veins, scratching, quiet | Easy (Midwife) |
| Stage 2 | 48-72 hours | Visible: fever, "hearing" something, pattern talk | Harder (Midwife + ritual) |
| Stage 3 | 72-96 hours | Shifting: flesh moves, lost time, whispers back | Significant effort |
| Stage 4 | Beyond | Transformation begins, becomes vector | May be too late |

The Midwife can cure her - but only with Jemini's consent. The Seeds are part of her now; removing them without permission would be "surgery without anesthesia. On the soul."

## Servants of the Newborn

### The Midwife (Vessel-of-Necessary-Change)

Midwives are the caretakers of Change. They don't cause transformation - they tend to it. Gardeners, not generals. Their role:
- Nurture Seeds that have been planted
- Guide transformation toward healthy outcomes
- Soothe those in the process of changing
- Ensure the Change flows properly

The Midwife is gentle, alien, and fundamentally incapable of violence. She serves the Newborn by maintaining the ecosystem of transformation - making sure things change *correctly*, not just change.

### Completed Transformations

Some people have successfully transformed - fully, properly, beautifully. They look human (mostly) but are not. They are:
- Networked to each other
- Connected to the Newborn
- Sapient and autonomous
- Living among normal people, undetected

Venn the archivist documented 73 transformations. Some of those "subjects" are still out there, successful, watching.

### The Incomplete

What happens when transformation goes wrong. Bori's death backlashed through his ritual network, activating Seeds without guidance. The result:
- Stuck mid-change, unable to complete
- In constant agony
- Drawn to the fragment (proximity soothes the pain)
- Not evil - just suffering

Killing them is mercy. Letting them reach the fragment is also mercy. Both are valid choices.

## Bori's Mistake

Bori Novoi, cult leader, wanted to commune with a god. He found something that responded to his attention. He mistook this for favor.

> "He mistook *attention* for *affection*. The Newborn noticed him the way you might notice an insect walking across your hand. He asked to be changed. It obliged. It did not ask what he wished to *become*."

Bori tried to:
- Dam the "channels" the Precursors built, redirect Change into himself
- Sacrifice his entire cult to power his apotheosis
- Become something vast and powerful through accumulated transformation

The party interrupted his ritual. Instead of absorbing his sacrifices and becoming something terrible, he became **Bori, Botched Apotheosis** - a gibbering mass of eyes, mouths, and tentacles. A failure. A warning.

His death backlashed through his network, creating The Incomplete.

## The Prismara Connection (FUTURE EVENT)

**This hasn't happened yet.** It will occur after the party meets the Midwife and interacts with the Newborn fragment.

Prismara is a Vlaka Prismeni - blind, but able to "see" through precognition. She perceives possibility, future-sight, probability.

Bori was studying Prismeni precognition. He wanted to replicate it:
> "If the Newborn grants Change, could it grant this? Communion should allow perception across time, not just space."

He was trying to become what Prismara already IS.

**When it happens** - during her interaction with the Newborn fragment:

> The pupil moves. For the first time in its very brief existence, it focuses on something.
> On *her*.

The Newborn will notice Prismara. This is unprecedented. For two years since hatching, the Newborn has existed without once directing its attention at anything. Reality warps around it, transformations happen, but it has never *looked*. Never *focused*. Never shown awareness of any individual thing.

And then it sees her.

The implications are unknown but probably significant.

**Trigger:** Interaction with the Newborn fragment in the cave, after meeting the Midwife.

## Relationship to the Precursors

The Precursors and the Newborn are opposing cosmic principles:
- **Precursors:** Control, containment, stasis, fragmentation
- **Newborn:** Change, flow, transformation, unity

But they're not enemies in a war. They're more like... forces that naturally counteract each other. The Precursors built "channels" to let Change flow without flooding. They respected the Newborn without worshipping it.

Now the balance is disrupted:
- The Precursor systems are degrading
- The Newborn's presence is spreading
- The channels are carrying more than they were designed for
- The fragmented nanites are being drawn back together

Whether this ends in catastrophe or transformation depends on what the party does.

## Thematic Notes

The Newborn represents **transformation without agenda** - change for its own sake, neither good nor evil, neither creative nor destructive. It simply IS.

This creates moral complexity:
- Is transformation good? Bad? Neither?
- Can you ethically prevent someone from changing if they want it?
- Can you ethically force transformation on someone who doesn't?
- What do you owe to those stuck mid-change?

The Newborn doesn't answer these questions. It doesn't even understand why they would be asked.

**Nobody is a bystander:** You cannot simply observe the Newborn's influence and remain unchanged. Proximity is participation. Jemini didn't choose to be infected - she was in the wrong place, trusted the wrong person. The Incomplete didn't choose their agony - Bori died and they paid the price. Even refusing to engage is a choice with consequences: leaving Jemini uncured, leaving the Midwife imprisoned, leaving the specimen jar unattended. The Newborn doesn't require your consent to include you in its transformations.

## GM Notes

### Tone

The Newborn should feel:
- Vast and alien
- Neither malevolent nor benevolent
- Fundamentally incomprehensible
- Present even when not visible

### Description Tips

Never describe the Newborn in terms that imply intention:
- NOT: "The Newborn wants you to change"
- YES: "Where the Newborn's presence touches, change happens"

Use natural metaphor:
- Rivers, not architects
- Weather, not generals
- Gravity, not hunters

### The Eye Moment (Future Event)

**Trigger:** When Prismara interacts with the Newborn fragment after meeting the Midwife.

Prismara being *noticed* will be a big deal. Something that has never focused will focus on her. This pays off at campaign climax. When it happens:
- Don't explain it
- Let it sit as mystery
- When players ask, answer: "You don't know what it means. But something that has never looked at anything before... looked at you."

**The Moment of Focus (Read Aloud to Prismara's Player):**

> You hear it before you understand it. A sound like tectonic plates grinding against each other, but slower. More deliberate. The creak of something that has never moved before learning how.
>
> The pressure changes. Not air pressure—something deeper. The weight of attention turning, the way you might feel someone's gaze in a dark room, but magnified beyond comprehension.
>
> A wet sound, impossibly vast. Fluid displacement on a scale that defies reason. You feel the vibration in your bones, in your teeth, in the spaces between your thoughts.
>
> Then: contraction. A tightening that you experience as subsonic rumble, as the sensation of falling without moving, as every hair on your body standing at attention.
>
> The pupil dilates.
>
> You don't see it—you *feel* it. The aperture widening like a door opening onto void. The sound is almost organic: a deep, resonant thrum that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere.
>
> And then it stops.
>
> Everything stops.
>
> The silence is worse than the sound. In that silence, you understand: you have been *noticed*.
>
> The eye of a being beyond imagining, a being that has never shown any sign of awareness for anything around it, has come into focus. And it is staring directly at you.

*Change comes. It does not ask permission. It does not offer explanation. It simply arrives, and after, nothing is what it was.*
