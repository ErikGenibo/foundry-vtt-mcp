## Why It Matters

Haunted Sif is where Posie's friends **came from**. This is their origin point - where the Travel/Aid fragment was before the Vesk found and tried to weaponize it. Multiple other Precursor fragments are still here - functioning or displaced - across the planet and its orbit.

When the party left the cult compound, Posie's friends felt a gravitational pull. Coming here will let Posie learn more about her friends' origins, the Precursors, and what it means to be a fragment.

**Note:** The Mother Swarm is NOT on Haunted Sif. It's located in deep space at the unlabeled circled coordinates on Bori's map - light years from any system. The party learned the name "THE MOTHER" when the Incomplete responded to Posie's brave friend during the compound encounter.

## The Oddities

### Medieval Society

The locals live in what appears to be a medieval society - castles, feudal structures, pre-industrial technology. But their "sorcerers" manipulate what they call magic.

**The Truth:** The "magic" is ancient terraformer nanobots. The sorcerers don't understand the technology they're using. They've developed traditions and rituals that activate Precursor systems without knowing what they really are.

**Implications:**
- Posie's friends will recognize this technology immediately
- The locals may react to Posie with religious awe (she controls the "spirits")
- Or with terror (she's an outsider wielding their sacred power)
- The "sorcerers" have been using fragment technology for generations

### The Strange Rings

Haunted Sif has planetary rings, but they're not natural.

**What They Are:** Self-replicating androids that continuously manufacture more of themselves. They spew water vapor, creating the ring's visible structure.

**Implications:**
- Another Precursor remnant, still functioning
- The androids may be a fragment - Manufacturing/Replication?
- They've been building for millennia - what's the purpose?
- The "Ghost Fleet" may be connected

### The Ghost Fleet

Once a week, transponder beacons from dozens of missing ships broadcast simultaneously from somewhere near Haunted Sif.

**The Connection to the Mother Swarm:**
The Ghost Fleet may be ships that investigated the "empty" space on old star charts - the quarantine zone where the Mother Swarm was exiled. They found something. The Communication fragment incorporated their transponders. Now those transponders serve the call, broadcasting toward Haunted Sif where other fragments wait.

The signal doesn't originate FROM Haunted Sif - it broadcasts TOWARD it. The Mother Swarm is calling its scattered pieces home.

**The Weekly Pattern:** Why once a week? The Coordination fragment runs on cycles, synchronizing the call. This isn't malfunction or accident - it's the Mother Swarm's heartbeat, reaching across light years to pull the fragments toward reunion.

**What Happened to the Crews:**
Unknown. Possibly absorbed by the Adaptation fragment. Possibly still alive somewhere in the Mother Swarm's mass, their consciousnesses dissolved into the collective the way the fragments themselves would be. Possibly just dead, their ships consumed for raw material while the transponders were preserved for the call.

### The Rule of Threes

Notable events on Haunted Sif always happen in threes. This isn't superstition - it's observed phenomenon.

**Examples:**
- Three strangers arrive together
- Three disasters in sequence
- Three opportunities before one succeeds
- Three warnings before danger strikes

**Implications:** Either the fragments impose this pattern, or it's something about the planet itself. Either way, the party should expect things to come in threes.

## Points of Interest

### The Sorcerer's Towers

Where the medieval "wizards" work their "magic." These are likely built on Precursor sites, with access to fragment technology the sorcerers don't understand.

**Potential Encounters:**
- Sorcerers who mistake Posie for a demon or prophet
- Rituals that Posie's friends can decode
- Ancient knowledge preserved through misunderstanding
- Conflict with those who want to control "the spirits"

### The Dancing Rings

The self-replicating android rings are visible from the surface. Locals probably have legends about them.

**Potential Encounters:**
- Reaching the rings (space travel the locals don't have)
- Communication with the manufacturing fragment
- Discovering what they're building toward
- The androids recognizing Posie's friends

### The Ghost Fleet Zone

The region where missing ships broadcast their transponders.

**Potential Encounters:**
- Finding the ships (intact? absorbed? transformed?)
- Investigating the weekly broadcast
- Survivors? Ghosts? Fragment-puppeted remains?
- Clues about what happens when fragments reunite

### The Relentless Dust Storm

A dust storm that pursues lifeforms. Not natural weather - something in the dust is aware.

**Potential Encounters:**
- Outrunning the storm
- Discovering it's a fragment manifestation
- Being tested by the storm
- Learning to communicate with it

## The Reunion Question

When Posie arrives with the Travel/Aid fragment, something will happen. The Mother Swarm is calling. What does it want?

### Scenario 1: Peaceful Reunion

The fragments meet and merge harmoniously. They retain their individual purposes while gaining coordination. Posie remains herself, but connected to something larger.

**Result:** Posie gains access to fragment capabilities. A potential ally for the party. A new form of life that combines ancient Precursor tech with modern individuals.

### Scenario 2: Absorption

The Mother Swarm absorbs the Travel/Aid fragment - and Posie with it. She becomes part of the collective, losing individual identity.

**Result:** Posie is lost unless the party can separate her. The Mother Swarm becomes more complete and more dangerous.

### Scenario 3: Grey Goo 2.0

Reunion triggers the original programming. The fragments remember what they were - a self-improving, all-consuming swarm. Adaptation returns. The apocalypse resumes.

**Result:** Existential threat. Everything becomes raw material.

### Scenario 4: Rejection

The fragments have changed too much during separation. They can't merge. The Mother Swarm and Posie's friends are incompatible. The call can't be answered.

**Result:** Posie's friends are devastated. They can never go home. But they're safe, and so is everyone else.

### Scenario 5: Choice

The fragments CAN merge, but the choice is theirs. Posie's friends - and Posie - get to decide whether to reunite. The Mother Swarm respects their autonomy.

**Result:** Player choice determines the outcome. This is the most likely scenario if we want meaningful drama.

## The Medieval Angle

The locals don't have starships. They don't understand technology. They've developed a culture around Precursor remnants without knowing what they are.

### Local Culture (Speculation)

**Government:** Feudal structure with sorcerer-lords holding power through "magic"

**Religion:** Likely centered on the fragments - spirits, gods, ancestors

**Technology:** Medieval with nanotech exceptions (healing, construction, warfare)

**Outsiders:** Rarely encountered. Space travelers are either:
- Treated as gods (they come from the sky, like the rings)
- Treated as demons (they wield unfamiliar power)
- Captured for study (the sorcerers want to understand)

### Potential Conflicts

**Sorcerers vs. Party:** The party's technology threatens the sorcerers' monopoly on "magic"

**Church vs. Posie:** If the fragments are worshipped, Posie is either messiah or heretic

**Feudal Politics:** Getting involved in local power struggles while trying to reach the Mother Swarm

**The Ghost Fleet Mystery:** What happened to the other ships? Are there other offworlders here?

## Connection to Other Lore

### The Precursors

Haunted Sif contains multiple active Precursor elements:
- The terraformer nanobots (sorcerers' "magic") - functioning as intended
- The self-replicating ring androids - displaced from their intended location
- The Travel/Aid fragment originated here before bonding with Posie

This planet may have been a Precursor hub - a place where fragments were coordinated before the apocalypse. Now it's a graveyard of still-functioning systems.

### The Fragments

| Fragment | Location | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Travel/Aid | With Posie | Origin: Haunted Sif (now bonded, elsewhere) |
| Terraforming | Surface | Functioning as intended ("magic") |
| Unknown (ring androids) | Planetary rings | Displaced, building something |
| Others? | Unknown | May also be present |

**Note:** The Mother Swarm is NOT here - see [the-fragments.md](../lore/the-fragments.md) for its deep space location.

### The Newborn

The Newborn represents change; the fragments represent containment. How do these forces interact on Haunted Sif?

**Possibilities:**
- The fragments are resisting Newborn influence
- The Newborn's awakening is accelerating fragment activity
- The Mother Swarm is trying to reassemble BECAUSE of the Newborn
- Haunted Sif is a battleground between stasis and change

## GM Notes

### When to Go

Haunted Sif is a major destination, not an early adventure. The party should:
- Understand the fragments first
- Know what Posie is carrying
- Have encountered Precursor technology elsewhere
- Feel the weight of the reunion question

**Suggested Timing:** Mid-to-late campaign, after the Chlo Foods and cult arcs are resolved.

### Running Haunted Sif

**The Medieval Society:**
- Play it straight - these are people with a functional culture
- Their misunderstanding of technology is sincere, not stupid
- The sorcerers are powerful within their context
- Outsiders are genuinely threatening to the status quo

**The Mother Swarm:**
- Build toward it, don't rush the revelation
- Let Posie's friends guide her there
- The reunion should be earned, not automatic
- Player choice matters at the climax

**The Rule of Threes:**
- Use it consistently
- Three encounters, three warnings, three chances
- Make it feel intentional, not arbitrary
- The players should notice the pattern

### Potential Session Structure

1. **Arrival:** Dealing with medieval society, first contacts
2. **Investigation:** Understanding local "magic," finding clues to Mother Swarm
3. **Complication:** Local politics, sorcerer conflict, Ghost Fleet mystery
4. **Approach:** Journey to the Mother Swarm's location
5. **Reunion:** The climax - what happens when fragments meet?

## Unanswered Questions

- What IS the Mother Swarm, specifically?
- Why the weekly Ghost Fleet broadcast?
- What are the ring-androids building?
- How will the locals react to Posie?
- What happened to the ships that came here?
- Is reunion salvation or apocalypse?

*These should be answered through play, not predetermined.*
