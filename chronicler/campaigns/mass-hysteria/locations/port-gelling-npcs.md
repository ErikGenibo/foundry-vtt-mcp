# Port Gelling - Market District NPCs

## Completed Descriptions

### Foreman Scritt (Ysoki)
*Location: Near spaceport stairs*

No-nonsense head of a Ysoki work crew. Almost never seen without a cigar hanging out of his mouth and a hardhat on his head, yelling at his laborers and negotiating with a Greeter Sweetiebot for the services of his crew. He doesn't much like skittermanders since they're so naturally helpful and he needs to earn a living by selling his services.

### The Shield that Encompasses (Barathu Swarm)
*Shop: The Shield that Encompasses' Cocoon (Armor)*

A large swarm of Barathu tending to customers, murmurating in harmony and exuding a sense of solidity and safety. The swarm is a singular entity who acts as the settlement's armor merchant. The barathu that comprise him have been unified for many years now, and are always on the lookout for other barathu who wish to merge.

---

### Katar (Vesk)
*Shop: Kill (Weapons)*

A Vesk expat who has trouble with the common tongue. He is happy to outfit anyone with any weapon he has to offer without prejudice, and has actually taken a liking to Ringo after Ringo greeted him and held a conversation with him in Vesk. In spite of his former service to the Veskarium and Ringo being a military-aged Pahtra with clear military training (who could be presumed to have fought for the liberation of his homeworld), Katar clearly carries no grudge. As far as he is concerned both have served their people honorably.

---

### Doctor Bobo (Skittermander)
*Shop: Clinic*

A female skittermander in a turquoise labcoat and oversized circular glasses (though you doubt anyone has checked her credentials). She is extremely helpful and excitable, as is common with her species, and would just LOVE it if everyone felt ALLLLLL better!

---

### Cog (Unknown species - heavily cybernetic)
*Shop: UPGRADE*

A cyborg that has been upgraded with prosthetics to the point it is impossible to tell their original species or gender, aside from being a medium sized humanoid. They are obsessed with perfection and long to replace their few organic components, including the holy grail of their brain. Living ship of theseus.

---

### ODDZ & ENDZ (Both Skittermanders)
*Shop: Oddz'n'Endz (General Store)*

Two skittermander partners run this chaotic general store, and somehow they make it work despite being polar opposites.

**ODDZ** is the scavenger - six arms constantly in motion as he zips around the shop moving "treasures" from one pile to another. He's the physical half of the operation, always out hunting for strange salvage or reorganizing inventory according to some system only he understands.

**ENDZ** is unusually grounded for a skittermander. Where most of his species are helpful to a fault, Endz is a keen negotiator who tries to squeeze every credit out of the weird crap Oddz drags back to the shop. He handles customers with surprising shrewdness.

They bicker constantly, six arms gesturing wildly, but there's obvious affection beneath the arguing. If you need something strange - unusual tech, weird magic items, salvage nobody else would touch - they probably have it somewhere in those towering piles.

---

### Asimov (Human)
*Shop: Asimov's Drones and Robotics*

An elderly human man with wispy white hair and old-fashioned spectacles runs this immaculate robotics shop. Asimov speaks softly and moves slowly, but his mind is sharp as a plasma cutter.

He's a genuine academic who ended up on the frontier - rumor has it he left a prestigious position at the Robotics division of a Pact Worlds university over ethical disagreements. He treats every drone he builds like a child, names them all, and insists on knowing who's buying and why - not because he thinks they're just tools, but because he believes they deserve *respect*.

He gets along extremely well with Cog from UPGRADE, despite their philosophical differences. Asimov argues machines should be treated with dignity and care. Cog dismisses this as sentimentality - they're metal and wire, replaceable. The irony of Cog dehumanizing machines while trying to become one is lost on neither of them. They've been debating this for years over weekly chess games.

---

### Chk Chk (Shirren)
*Shop: Chk Chk's Long Term Storage and Molting Assistance*

A patient Shirren runs this unassuming garage, which serves two functions: secure long-term storage for spacers who need to leave belongings behind, and private molting assistance for Shirren who need a safe, comfortable space for the vulnerable process.

Chk Chk (the clicks are soft and precise) is a former hive-mind who chose individuality decades ago. They speak rarely, think carefully, and never, ever gossip about what's in their storage units. This discretion has made them invaluable to Port Gelling's less reputable residents.

The molting rooms in the back are supposedly the cleanest, most comfortable facilities in the system. Shirren travel from across the sector to molt here.

### First Equal Krull (Dragonkin), Chairperson Shuuthul (Kalo), & Jim (Human)
*Shop: The One Stop Tip-Top Pawnshop/Trade Swap/Chop-Shop Shoppe Co-op*

Three wildly different species somehow run this sprawling pawnshop together, and nobody's quite sure how they met or why they stay together.

**First Equal Krull** is an enormous dragonkin who handles heavy equipment, ship parts, and anything that requires lifting. His title is self-given - he believes deeply in worker equality and refuses any hierarchy, even in his own business. He's loud, opinionated, and genuinely kind.

**Chairperson Shuuthul** is a Kalo who operates from a custom water tank that wheels around the shop floor. She handles appraisals, negotiations, and paperwork. Her title is *also* self-given, ironically mocking corporate culture. She's dry-witted and unflappable.

**Jim** is a middle-aged human who does... everything, really. While Krull and Shuuthul bicker about philosophy and proper business practices, Jim is the one actually running the shop. He remembers where the ledgers are. He knows the inventory. He makes sure everyone's fed. Most of the actual work gets done by him, quietly and without complaint.

The trio wouldn't work without Jim, and neither would the pawnshop. He's warm, reliable, and genuinely good - the kind of person who makes a place feel like home.

*[Note: Jim is a memorial character. Protected.]*

The "Chop-Shop" part of the name is technically a joke. Technically.

### Adrogall (Astrazoan presenting as Human)
*Shop: Honest Adrogall's Ship Mall*

A friendly, forgettable-looking human man runs the largest ship dealership in Port Gelling. He's got a firm handshake, a ready smile, and prices that are suspiciously reasonable.

**Adrogall** is actually an Astrazoan - a shapeshifter - though almost nobody knows this. He doesn't hide it out of malice; he just finds that people trust "a regular guy" more than an amorphous alien when making major purchases. He's been "human" so long he sometimes forgets.

His ships are legitimate, his prices are fair, and his service is excellent. The "Honest" in the name isn't ironic. He's simply discovered that *actual* honesty is the best long-term business strategy. The secret he's keeping is about identity, not merchandise.

---

### Todd (Elf)
*Shop: Gelling Bar and Grill*

An elf bartender runs the most popular watering hole in Port Gelling with quiet efficiency and absolutely zero interest in your problems.

**Todd** has been tending bar here for longer than most residents have been alive. He pours drinks, wipes counters, and offers no advice whatsoever. He's seen everything, heard everything, and forgotten most of it on purpose.

The food is exactly what the sign promises: "Cold Food, Hot Beer, or whatever our supplier had extra of." Todd doesn't cook - there's a rotating cast of line cooks in the back who never seem to last more than a few months. The drinks, however, are consistently excellent. Todd takes pride in exactly one thing, and that's it.

If you want sympathy, go to Adrogall. If you want healing, go to Doctor Bobo. If you want a drink and blessed silence, Todd's your elf.

### "Doctor" Fowl (Sarcesian)
*Shop: Happy Varmint Pharmaceuticals*

A tall, thin Sarcesian runs this chemical-scented establishment with an air of distracted brilliance. The shop's freshly replaced windows and visible scorch marks tell you everything you need to know about Quality Assurance around here.

**"Doctor" Fowl** (nobody's seen credentials, nobody's asked) specializes in... creative pharmaceuticals. Stimulants, sedatives, and things that defy easy categorization. The sign outside shows a blissed-out eight-legged weasel smiling blankly - not far off from the expression of satisfied customers leaving.

She speaks in rapid, technical jargon, half of which might be made up. Her void-adapted physiology means she rarely sleeps, which explains both her productivity and her increasingly experimental product line. Safe? Probably. Effective? Definitely. Legal? The Pact Worlds are far away.

---

### Fr3d (Observer-Class Security Robot)
*Location: Patrols the Market District*

An Observer-Class Security Robot with a designation that somehow became a name. Fr3d is identical to every other security robot in Port Gelling... except for the part where he has a personality.

Something in his code glitched years ago. Now he hums tunelessly on patrol. He's given names to every other security robot (they don't respond, or care). He occasionally stops to "admire" displays in shop windows, his optical sensors tracking movement for slightly too long.

The locals are oddly fond of him. Merchants wave. Children follow him around. When the Port Authority suggested replacing him, there was nearly a riot. Fr3d remains on active duty, blissfully unaware of how strange he is.

---

### All Day Cafe
*No notable NPCs - just a tea shop*

A stylish Trellis sign in the shape of a rising sun marks this quiet tea shop. Popular with locals who want a moment of peace away from the market chaos.

---

### Herman (Human)
*Location: Market Stand (no shop name)*

A large, rotund human man with an impressive waxed handlebar mustache and a bulbous bald head that gleams in the market lights. Herman is surrounded at all times by his four personal squoxes - the eight-legged weasel-like creatures scamper around him, across his shoulders, and occasionally perch on his head.

Herman seems a little slow, but genuinely happy. He desperately wants to sell you a squox. He will cajole, wheedle, demonstrate their many fine qualities, and assure you that "this one really likes you, I can tell." His sales pitch is relentless. His success rate is not.

**The Secret:** One of those "squoxes" isn't a squox at all - it's an **Empathnid**, a tiny psychic arachnid that has attached itself to Herman as a protector. It psychically guides him - keeping him calm, content, and safe. The empathnid genuinely cares for him in its alien way. Herman's simple happiness is real, just... guided.

The empathnid watches everyone who approaches with its Emotionsense. If anyone means Herman harm, they'll find out that one of those cute pets has fangs and a very protective streak.

*[GM Note: The empathnid provides +1 circumstance bonus to saves vs emotion/mental effects while sharing Herman's space, and can stabilize him with Stabilizing Antivenom if he's ever dying.]*
